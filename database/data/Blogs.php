            [content] => <h2 >1. The Weather</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-658 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/grand-harbour-panoramic-view-2.jpg" alt="Grand Harbour Panoramic View (2)" width="5506" height="2256" />
Malta is in a state of perpetual summ er almost all year long. Known for its 300 days of sunshine, our sunny little island enjoys mild temperatures even during the months of January and February. Storms just pass by, and usually clear up after a few hours.

<h2 >2. The People</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-663 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/2014-10-25-20-23-05.jpg" alt="2014-10-25-20.23.05" width="640" height="360" />
The Maltese are known for their kind-heartedness and their eagerness to help anyone in need. You can ask a local for help with anything from directions, to where to visit. Chances are you'll make a Maltese friend pretty quickly (and get some expert local advice along the way)

<h2 >3. The Language</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-673 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/image.jpg" alt="image" width="2000" height="510" />
Don't get me wrong, the Maltese language is not an easy one to master, especially if you are here on a short trip. However, the majority of the population speaks English as their second language, as it is taught in schools from a very young age. English is also Malta's second official language.

<h2 >4. The Food</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-679 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/malta-pastizzi-3_800x533.jpg" alt="Malta-Pastizzi-3_800x533" width="800" height="533" />
Whether it's two freshly baked 'pastizzi' or a mouth-watering rabbit stew, Maltese cuisine is hearty and tasty. Combining Mediterranean elements with some British touches, our cuisine has borrowed something from all the countries we were colonised by in past years and is now typically ours. Make sure to get two baking hot date cakes from Valletta, and some fresh fish from Marsaxlokk!

<h2 >5. The History</h2>
<img src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/malta-120223-506-edit.jpg" alt="Malta-120223-506-Edit" width="1600" height="898" />
Malta is a history buff's paradise! From temples which out-date the pyramids of Egypt, to fortified cities - there is 3000 years of history clustered in the Maltese islands. The prehistoric temples are a definite must-see, and if you're short on time, a quick trip to Valletta will replenish all your historical needs, as there is something significant to behold at every corner.

<h2 >6. The Beaches</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-692 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ramla.jpg" alt="ramla" width="3264" height="2448" />
Known as being among Malta's major attractions, its myriad of beaches suit everyone's taste. From sandy beaches with sprawling reddish sand, to clean cut white rocky beaches, there is something for everyone. The northern part of Malta is where most beaches are located, however there are a few hidden gems in the southern part as well. Visit Mellieha Bay for a taste of the Maltese summer, or head to the northern-most Armier bay for crystal clear waters and white sand.

<h2 >7. The Nightlife</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-704 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/gianpula1.jpg" alt="gianpula" width="570" height="476" />
The Maltese clubbing scene has been rising steadily, and now rivals that of Ibiza and Ayia Napa as a clubbing paradise. Although the high season for this scene is undoubtedly the summer, many DJs, local and international, organize events all year long. The main hub for this scene is of course the notorious Paceville, which is flooded with people every weekend. Other places to try are Numero Uno in Ta' Qali, as well as Cafe del Mar in Qawra during the summer months.

<h2 >8. Its small size</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-718 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/14017140523_26a76158d8_b.jpg" alt="14017140523_26a76158d8_b" width="971" height="521" />
Malta covers just over 316 sq km, and can be crossed from Northern most tip to Southern most tip in less than 2 hours (given there is no traffic). This means that getting from one place to another is easy and quick. A 'long' commute for the Maltese consists of an hour-long car ride. We are minuscule compared to other countries, and there are even some cities which are bigger than the whole island! And with a population of over 400,000 people, it means that it is less crowded than most other cities too!

<h2 > 9. Gozo</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-721 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/gozo-habour_1854937b.jpg" alt="gozo-habour_1854937b" width="620" height="388" />

Malta's little sister island is a wonder in itself. With picturesque beaches, quaint harbours, sea-side towns and rural villages, Gozo is a tiny gem to be  explored.  Make sure to take a picture with the Azure Window in Dwejra, which made its big screen début in Game of Thrones. Mgarr ix-Xini Bay also served as a cinematic backdrop in 'By the Sea' filmed entirely on the island. Another plus - getting to Gozo by ferry offers you an unlimited view of all 3 islands, giving you a new perspective on the Maltese archipelago!

            [content] => <h3>Malta - our little island in the middle of the vast Mediterranean Sea. Yet, many have not heard of it, do not know where it is, do not know of our language, do not know her people.</h3>
Here are some very quick facts, brushing up your skills on Malta and the Maltese:
<ol>
	<li>Malta is an independent island, of just 316 km<sup>2 </sup></li>
	<li>It is located towards the south of Sicily</li>
	<li>Malta has its own language, Maltese, which finds its origins in Semitic and Romance languages. Some English words have now been incorporated in the vocabulary as well.</li>
	<li>The Maltese islands are made up of 3 main islands; Malta, the biggest island in the archipelago; Gozo, the second biggest island of only 67 km sq; and Comino, the smallest, barely inhabited island.</li>
	<li>Malta has been colonized by many peoples over the years, the longest being by the Knights of St John, and by the British.</li>
	<li>Euro is the official currency as of 2008, with the Maltese Lira preceding it.</li>
	<li>Malta has a population of just over 400,000.</li>
	<li>The Capital City is Valletta, built by and named after the Grandmaster Jean Parisot de la Vallette.</li>
	<li>We drive on the left side of the road (or the wrong side of the road for many), a custom left by the British rule in Malta.</li>
	<li>Our climate is hot and dry in the Summer, and humid but mild in the Winter. Average temperature in Summer is of 32ºC, while in Winter it is of 14ºC.</li>
</ol>
Malta is much, much more than this - it is an island abounding in culture, history and art. It is made up of a fun-loving, caring people, who can squabble one minute and laugh the next. It is an island made up of sun, sea, and bright colours - from the traditional Luzzu boats to the brightly painted covered balconies. It is a treasure to be discovered, and to be treasured. There is something for absolutely everyone, from the quiet streets of the Silent City to the roaring, raging weekly summer Festas. Come and see for yourself!

		<!--<p>In the past few years, holiday rentals - be it apartments, condos or villas - have grown steadily in popularity as the most opted for accommodation choice. This trend has never been as en vogue as it is right now; whilst holiday homes have been around for many years, the surge and demand for more and more holiday rental property is a relatively new concept. Hotels are on the decline, while holiday rentals are on a steady incline. However, what makes a holiday rental such a favourable option, over an accommodation which offers breakfast and cleaning services on a daily basis?</p> -->

<!-- <h2 >1. Vacation Rentals actually cost less than hotels.</h2>
<img class="  wp-image-827 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/moneh.jpg" alt="moneh" width="666" height="443" />
<p>Are you counting your pennies and saving up every Euro for your upcoming holiday? (Aren't we all!). Indeed, everyone loves saving money. Why spend €500 when you could get the same deal for €250? Believe it or not, a vacation rental will cost you significantly less than a hotel would. Imagine being a family of 5 and renting a family room or else two rooms in a hotel. Family rooms are one of the most expensive options you can opt for when booking a hotel room, while the price of two rooms is obviously doubling all costs. Booking one 3-bedroom house will prove to be much, much cheaper - as you would be paying for the house, regardless of the amount of people. For example,  a family room in a typical 4-star hotel would cost you around €1600 for a week in July, while a 3-bedroom house, for the same dates, in the same area, would cost you around €950. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a hefty save of €650. Still convinced that a hotel is the best option?</p>

<h2 >2. You get so much more space!</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-842" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/home.jpg" alt="home" width="2509" height="1673" />
<p>If you could choose between having a whole apartment to yourself, or having a bedroom and en-suite bathroom, which one would you opt for? You know the answer, no need to spell it out for you. You get more than triple times the space you would get in a cramped hotel room, while paying significantly less! What's not to love?! Plus, you also get the added privacy of going in and out at whatever time you please (without any nosy Receptionists or Night Receptionists tutting and shaking their heads as you walk in barefooted at 5am). For you, dear parents - would you rather share a room with your kids, or having them share a room with each other, giving you some peace and quiet? Thought so  :)</p>

<h2 >3. Having a Kitchen, you'll save big bucks on food.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/food.jpg" alt="food" width="2000" height="1335" />
<p>I know, I know - who the hell wants to cook while they're on holiday?! People on a budget, that's who! Also, people who love to sleep in (alternatively missing breakfast cause you woke up after 10am), people visiting notoriously expensive cities (alternatively forking out ridiculous amounts of money for gourmet plates which barely fill you up), people with food intolerances (alternatively having to look  for specialised restaurants or having to ask each and every chef about how the food is prepared), and the list goes on and on. Need more convincing? Imagine waking up at whatever time you want to wake up, being unrestricted by breakfast times or dinner times, and eating whatever tickles your fancy, instead of eating from a set menu. Ah, the kitchen life!</p>

<h2 >4. Live like a local.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-875" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/local.jpg" alt="local" width="4000" height="2713" />
<p>Sure, your camera and back-pack will still give you away for the bright-eyed tourist that you are, however, nothing screams 'Tourist' more than a hotel. Want to mingle with locals? A hotel is generally the worst place to start. Locals do not frequent hotels for the same reason you do not hang around hotels in your city - cause you live there! Chances of meeting local people while staying in a hotel are slight. Living in a rental home puts you smack dab in the heart of the local scene - start with your neighbours - a friendly 'Good Morning' or 'Hello' can be an ice-breaker. Most people are willing to help, if you only have the nerve to ask. So fire away, ask any local you meet about the best hangouts in town and you will get top-notch advice. You can also eat as the locals do - buy fresh local produce, local bread - any local speciality. You will be experiencing much more than just a package holiday!</p>

<h2 >5. (Sometimes) Pets are welcome.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-884" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pet.jpg" alt="pet" width="5377" height="3585" />
<p>True - this does not apply to each and every vacation rental, however rental home owners tend to be more flexible when it comes to allowing pets. Be prepared to pay a slightly higher security deposit, but you can get this back in full if your beloved pooch leaves everything intact. Hotels are way more fussy when it comes to allowing pets, and most of them flatly refuse to allow pets altogether. And let's face it, one of the hardest things about going on holiday is leaving your adorable four-legged friend behind, so why put yourself through that kind of trauma?</p>

<h2 >6. A WASHING MACHINE.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-893" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/washer.jpg" alt="washer" width="5472" height="3648" />
<p>BYE RYAN-AIR OVERWEIGHT FEES! Why, why, why lug around a fortnight's worth of clothing, causing you to put on half your luggage's worth of clothes at the airport to avoid overweight fees, ending up with TONS of laundry to do as soon as you arrive home? WHY? Cause hotels have no washing machines, that's why. And because hotel laundry service is daylight robbery, that's why. Surprise surprise, you're most likely to find a washing machine (and sometimes a dryer too!) in every, single, rental home. This means that you can half your luggage weight by bringing a lot less clothes (leaving more room for mementos!), and you have very little laundry to do when you go back home. If that's not a sweet deal, we don't know what is.</p> -->

            [content] => It is common knowledge that stress is a killer. When you are stressed, your body does not function properly, making you more prone to illness; your mind is over-worked and thus leads to making rash decisions; and you are simply not 100% there. Stress can ruin you, in every possible way. Fortunately there is a solution to combat this stressful predator – a break from everyday life and day-to-day routine, which provides a much needed rest for mind, body and soul.  That is all well and good; I can hear you say, but what about the kids? True - what about the kids? Should holidays be child-free? Do parents deserve a break more than the children do? Would bringing the kids along actually increase stress levels? We sat down for a chat with Elaine Grech a therapist specialising in Family Issues, to get more insight about the love/hate relationship of the Family Holiday.

<strong>What constitutes a pleasant family holiday, in your opinion?</strong>

<strong>E.G.</strong>: I think that the families who manage to enjoy holidays the most are the ones who find a way of getting along, who manage to resolve the conflicts that they might have and which might arise, and who feel that their needs are being taken care of and catered for. Taking into consideration each family member’s needs during the planning of the holiday will ensure that there is something to please everyone, and thus the holiday is more pleasurable for all.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/family-3.jpg" alt="Family 3.jpg" width="4348" height="3261" />

<strong>What psychological benefits can a family enjoy when going on a family holiday?</strong>

<strong>E.G.:</strong> When people look back on their childhood, they do not recollect material things; it is the memories which stand out mostly. These memories may be of the simplest things, such as going to the beach or cooking a pie together as a family, however it is these memories which stick the most through adulthood. By going on a family holiday, parents and children have time to dedicate for each other, without any external distractions such as work. Thus they create new, bonding memories, and manage to get involved in new experiences together as a family. The time invested in the family is beneficial to the whole household.

<strong>How does the holiday affect the psychological well-being of the parents, and of the children in the end?</strong>

<strong>E.G.:</strong> This is dependent on whose needs are being catered for during the holiday. As an example, in a family of two caregivers, where one lounges around and does nothing while the other takes care of the children and other chores, there will be no balance and this will create unhappiness in the whole family unit. If both caregivers support each other and help each other in their daily chores, then there is going to be a shared happiness between them and also with the children. The whole family has to work together as one team, including the children as well, thus giving them an idea of what it means to be a loving unit. It is also a good idea to include the children in choice-making, for example, giving them a choice between two parks, and letting them decide which one they prefer. This creates a sense of independence and also of importance in the children, instead of always tagging around wherever their caregivers choose to take them.



<strong>Does the holiday necessarily always have to be child oriented or are there particular ages when planning a holiday around the child’s needs is a must?</strong>

<strong>E.G.:</strong> There are different types of holidays. If the holiday is a family holiday, then yes, it is very important to include the children in the planning process, choose destinations which are child friendly, and choose child-friendly activities as much as possible. Bear in mind that the things you enjoy doing single, or with other adults – such as going to museums, art galleries, concerts – may not be enjoyable for the child as well. However, there can be instances where your needs and your child’s needs meet – for example I once went to a castle in Scotland; I loved it because of the medieval history and the children loved it because they could run around in the huge garden. You have to be flexible when travelling with children and keep in mind that activities which are constricted by time may not be suitable for them, as it adds extra pressure. Plan one activity a day, and be flexible as much as you can. Remember that is your child is frustrated and angry, you will probably end up this way too.

<strong>What kind of precautions should be taken by parents to ensure the best possible vacation for all family members?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>The best way is to plan ahead and make sure that the children are properly entertained, especially while travelling by airplane or by train, so that they do not get frustrated from boredom. I have had some families which some traumatised from a family holiday, after horrifying long journeys with kids in the car or the plane.  Planning ahead is the key. Pack some activities they love, and let them pack a bag each (as long as what they pack abides by travelling regulations). I give each of my children a travelling bag which they can then fill with any favourite toys and activities they want, so that they don’t get bored. This gives them responsibility as well; as they make sure they are bringing what is most important to them.

<strong>Family relationships can be even put on strain since the holiday will deviate from the normal routine of everyday life. How can one compensate for this, especially with regards to children?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>Reflect and set out the expectations for the holiday beforehand. For example, in a traditional family setting with a working father and stay at home mother – would the father spend the whole day doing nothing while on holiday since he does not have to work, while the mother carries on with her daily routine of taking care of the children, cooking, cleaning – these roles should be shared during a holiday environment, as the routine is somewhat changed. The sleeping pattern of the children is also another thing to bear in mind when planning a holiday, since there are no school days. The planning of this has to be thought of beforehand, also with regards to travelling time.

<strong>How often is it recommended to go on family holidays?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>This obviously depends on the financial situation of the family, a family who manages to take regular family holidays is truly blessed, as these offer new experiences and broaden the horizons of all the members of the family, especially the children. Unfortunately not all families can afford a family holiday, however even a local trip can benefit the family as a whole. It has to be made sure that in order to take a holiday the other family’s needs are not put under strain. However, money spent on holidays is invested in memories, and never goes to waste. Holidays can be educational and are mind-opening to the children.

<strong>Do psychological benefits increase when travelling with extended family members (grandparents, aunts, uncles), or should family trips be kept to the immediate family members (parents, children)?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>It depends on the type of relationship there is between these family members, so it varies from family to family. In our culture in Malta, it is quite common to be connected to our extended family, so being on holiday with them can work out as long as the family members get along well. One must see that all the family members share and uphold the same core values, as sharing a home with someone who holds different values from you could be difficult. However, as long as differences can be respected and boundaries are set, a family holiday with the extended family can be a very beneficial experience.

            [content] => Food is not just a means of nourishment for many. It is treated like a social vehicle; the act of eating is used as a medium - to meet up with family or friends, to discuss business, to celebrate an occasion. People seem to bond over food, making it a powerful social tool. Now imagine having this tool taken away from you, being unable to enjoy a bite to eat at a restaurant without fearing for your life.  Welcome to the life of an allergy sufferer.
Many people nowadays throw the word ‘allergy’ around without really knowing what it means. There is often a confusion between the words ‘allergy’ and ‘intolerance’. Someone who suffers from an intolerance – be it lactose intolerance, gluten and wheat intolerance, yeast intolerance – will feel ill after ingesting these products.  Intolerance is a sign that the body is not capable of digesting the food eaten or that the food being eaten irritates the digestive system.  A person who suffers from an allergy however, is prone to feel ill when an allergen is ingested too, yet there is also an impending life-threatening reaction connected to the allergen.  This is caused when the body’s immune system, which usually wards off infections, sees the food being ingested as an invader. This leads to an allergic reaction in the body – which reaction can cause symptoms such as breathing problems, throat tightness, coughing, vomiting, abdominal pain, swelling and a drop in blood pressure. Allergic reactions are not always consistent; someone who has had a mild allergic reaction before may have a life threatening reaction the next time.  Even contamination of utensils and equipment may lead to a grave allergic reaction, and thus precautions must be taken. Yet, living in a world where eating is a social activity, someone suffering from a food allergy may often feel left out, his/her (very serious) needs neglected.
We spoke to Dr. Mario Aquilina, a Lecturer at the University of Malta and father of a 5 year-old boy who has been suffering from a food allergy since he was just a year old. His young son had to be admitted to hospital as a toddler when he had an allergic reaction to a particular ingredient, which at the time could not be isolated. This caused the family to undergo a huge overhaul in their lives, removing all traces of food which might trigger a reaction.

<strong>What changes have you made in your everyday life to make sure your son can eat healthily and safely?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>You have to be prepared to read and understand ingredients on products, as sometimes a different jargon is used in labelling. We had to eliminate certain products produced in Malta unfortunately, since the labelling on these products is not always thorough, and thus not always safe. We have had to be more careful about cross-contamination of kitchen utensils and pots and pans, making sure to clean everything well before reusing it to prepare something else. It is important to read and to be informed about the issue as much as possible and to hand-pick restaurants before eating out.  Travelling has become complicated; however we usually opt for self-catering apartments when going abroad, so that we are 100% safe in regards to food, which we prepare ourselves.
<strong>What might help to increase awareness about food allergies and their serious consequences especially in Malta?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>Awareness is increasing from when my son was first diagnosed with his allergy, almost 5 years ago. Many restaurants now write on their menus that allergy sufferers need to speak to the waiter or the chef; however they are often not willing to take the risk and advertise themselves as ‘allergy-friendly’ as it then puts a lot of responsibility on the restaurateurs, who would obviously not want to be held accountable should someone have an allergic reaction. I myself have spoken with various hotel and restaurant managers regarding this issue, as, if viewed in the long-run, catering for allergy sufferers benefits their business rather than hinders it. If, for example, there is a family of 5 persons, including a person suffering from an allergy who cannot eat at a particular restaurant because it does not cater for allergy sufferers, then this restaurant would have lost a potential table of 5 clients. Investing in different pans and separate cooking oil may seem burdensome and wasteful for many restaurant owners; however this proves to be beneficial in the long run, as instead of shunning people away by not catering for everyone’s needs, you then actually draw people in. Awareness is increasing in Malta, but the Government has to implement changes on the labelling of Maltese products, providing an allergen sheet as in the UK. The Facebook page I set up, ‘Eating Out with Special Dietary Requirements’ mentions places which have offered a pleasant experience when eating out with my son. A lot of restaurants are not yet fully willing to advertise themselves that they do indeed cater for allergy sufferers, but people on social media can share their experiences, good or bad, so that more people are informed about which restaurants they can choose.

<strong>What do allergy sufferers, especially foreigners, have to look for when choosing a restaurant?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>In my opinion, you cannot enjoy eating somewhere unless you fully trust that your needs are going to be catered for as you require, without cross-contamination of utensils and equipment, and with proper care in the selection of ingredients. A restaurant must be researched before, and it is best to call before making the reservation, so that you can state clearly that there will be someone who is allergic to some ingredients in your party, to see if the restaurant will be able to cope with these demands. Once at the restaurant, it is imperative to ask again, and to state again which ingredients cannot be ingested by said person. It is best to talk both to the person in charge – be it a head waiter or chef – as well as to the waiter serving you, to make sure that there is more than one person who is aware of the situation. This way the allergy sufferer can put his/her mind at rest and truly enjoy the experience of dining, and the whole party can enjoy the meal together. Unfortunately sometimes there is miscommunication between the waiter and the chef, especially if the waiter is not yet trained enough. Allergy sufferers are sometimes mistaken for fussy or picky eaters, and the staff thinks that they are merely complaining or being a nuisance. Having an allergy is a far-cry from being fussy. It is important that you explain what the situation is, and how serious the reaction might be should the allergen be ingested in some way, or if some equipment is cross-contaminated. It is your right to feel comfortable with what you are eating and it is the establishment’s duty to offer food which is safe to eat.

<strong>Which restaurants have you found to provide the best service when catering for allergy sufferers?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>There are a number of restaurants which have been indeed very welcoming and very considerate when dealing with people with special dietary requirements, most of which I mention in my Facebook Page ‘Eating Out with Special Dietary Requirements’ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HappyRestaurants/?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/HappyRestaurants/?fref=ts</a>. Here I list my experiences in restaurants across Malta and Gozo which have provided excellent service and a good choice of food catering for different dietary requirements. A quick mention - Amorino, the ice-cream shop in Republic Street, Valletta, is very helpful as it has an allergen sheet where one can see each different ingredient in the various ice-creams they offer.

            [content] => Kitesurfing is a relatively new sport, becoming a mainstream sport in 1999. It is a surface water sport which combines elements from wakeboarding, windsurfing, surfing and paragliding. A kitesurfer uses the power of the wind with the kite to propel him/herself across the water, while also using the waves to be able to jump higher. It is not a sport for the faint-hearted, and it is certainly not a sport to try on your own, as there could be some serious injuries. Water-sports have always been a part of island living, and having so many beaches to choose from in such short distances, makes Malta an ideal location for practicing water-sports.

We spoke to Ralph Vella, company director of Shortlets Malta Ltd., and avid kitesurfer, about this fairly new water-sport.

<strong>What drew you to kitesurfing?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Back in 2002, when I started kitesurfing, this sport was very new, and the only things we knew about it were what had seen from the internet. I was very interested and wanted to try it out, since I had already been keen on windsurfing. A small demonstration was set up in Malta by a kitesurfer from the UK, and he showed us what to do and we had some equipment which we could try out.

<strong>Do you need to have a background in some other type of sport to be able to kitesurf?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>It is not particularly necessary; however, if you have a background in wakeboarding or in surfing, this will help you greatly with your board skills. If you have even flown a stunt kite or a traction kite, you will have a better idea of how to handle the kite as well. I did not have either of the two, which made it a bit harder for me, and since the sport was just beginning and the equipment was still quite primitive, it took me about 2 years to learn how to properly practice this sport.

<strong style="line-height:1.7;">Do you need to take specific lessons to practice kitesurfing, or can you learn on your own?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Yes, you need to take lessons, even though I learned on my own. Today there are IKO (International Kitesurfing Organisation) Instructors in Malta, who are certified instructors specifying in this sport. These instructor make the sport safer, and they teach you all you need to know to feel safe while kitesurfing. One of the drawbacks of kitesurfing in Malta is that the wind is always onshore, so if something goes wrong while practicing the sport, you can be dragged on to the beach. It is important to always know exactly what you are doing while kitesurfing.

<strong>Does this sport require only a kite and a surfboard?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>No, these are the two main pieces of equipment you need, however there are different types for different situations. For example while kitesurfing you will need more than one kite for different winds; the stronger the wind, the smaller the kite has to be. In my case I have three kites, a 14sqm for light wind, an 11sqm for medium winds and a 7sqm for strong wind, Force 7 and rough conditions. There are also different kinds of boards – usually the most basic board is a twin-tip, meaning it can be steered in both directions, having no front-end or back-end. Then there are more specialised surf boards for riding waves, however these are usually used by more advanced riders who want to have a further challenge while kitesurfing to ride the waves with the kite, which is a more difficult thing to do.

<strong>What safety precautions do you need to take prior attempting to kitesurf?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>The most important thing is knowing the direction of the wind, and making sure that the wind is a good condition for kitesurfing. Then you need to choose the right equipment. For example, if you are going kitesurfing on a day when the wind is onshore Force 5, you need to choose the right location, the right size of kite and board, and you need to pay attention to other people in the water. When jumping you need to make sure that there is nothing and no one downwind of you, so that you do not get hurt, otherwise it is very easy to injure yourself or those around you.

<strong>Is kitesurfing suitable for anyone to try?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Kitesurfing is not ideal for children, as you have to be attentive and know what you’re doing at all times. The youngest kitesurfer I met in Malta was 15 years old. However this does not mean that you cannot kitesurf if you are young, you just need to be very careful and stay alert, as it can be very dangerous is you do not know what you are doing. The oldest kitesurfer I know is a friend of mine, who is about 45 years old, so not too old either. In Malta we were only 5 people in the beginning, when the sport was just starting; but now in the last 5 years or so, we have gone up to about 50 people. Obviously we are never all together on the beach! The most we have been is about 20 kites.

<strong>Can you kitesurf alone? Or should there always be someone with you to help you if needed?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>You can kitesurf alone theoretically, however I never did, as to launch a kite on your own you have to use a kind of anchor, or at least a rope tied to something heavy, and since the beaches in Malta are quite small this can be a bit dangerous, especially if you are alone. Usually, I do not make specific plans to meet up with other kitesurfers but I always seem to find someone practicing the sport whenever I go. Unfortunately there is no Kitesurfing Club yet in Malta; however you can always find the same group of people kitesurfing here and there. There are quite a few people in Malta who have tried it out, however it is only a few who are still practicing it regularly.

<strong>What makes kitesurfing more challenging than windsurfing?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>I do not personally think it is more challenging than windsurfing; however they are different from each other. For windsurfing you need to have windier conditions than for kitesurfing. What makes kitesurfing more challenging in Malta is the lack of space, as for kitesurfing you need at least 30m of beach to open your lines, whereas for windsurfing you can go off the rocks. In Malta, especially in summer when the beaches are packed, we have to find our own solutions as to how to launch the kite and where to land it, as there are the swimmers only zones in use as well. I would say kitesurfing is more of a winter sport, at least in Malta.

<strong>Is Malta an ideal location for kitesurfing?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Malta is ideal yes, as it is an island and you can get all the wind directions in different locations. There is no ‘best’ beach, as it mostly depends on the wind direction, but the most ideal beach for learning especially, is (Ghadira) Mellieha Bay, simply because it is the largest beach on the island. My favourite beach has to be Riviera Bay, which is one of the hardest places to kitesurf in Malta, as when the wind is strong very big waves form there. You can use these waves as a makeshift ramp to push you up, and you can time the jump with the kite together with the wave so you get really high jumps. However, this is best to attempt if you are skilled in the sport and you are an experienced rider.

You are a history buff, your travels are mostly centred around historical sites, museums and exhibitions, and you long to know the story behind every stone. Your ideal vacation home would be an old castle, or a refurbished historical building. Although you would rather explore the history of wherever you travel to, you need a place to rest after a hard day's learning. An antique, historical residence provides you with enough history to keep you entertained while you get some rest!

You might have expensive taste, but you would choose utmost comfort over bare necessities any day. Your holidays are mainly centred around lounging, shopping, and fine dining (with some more lounging thrown in there for good measure)

            [content] => A trip to Gozo should be on everyone’s bucket-list. Our little sister island, known for its magnificent three hills, is a natural splendour, still very much raw and unspoilt. The Gozitans are friendly and welcoming (albeit being somewhat quieter than their Maltese neighbours), and the island offers a totally different feel than Malta does. Even if you can visit for just a day, it is still worth the while. A rental car/jeep is a must if you want to see as many sights as possible, and you will be surprised to find that Gozitan roads make for a far smoother ride than Maltese ones! The island is just begging to be explored, so buckle up, map in hand, and begin your journey!

<strong><u>Getting there</u></strong>

You can reach Gozo either by sea, or by helicopter. There is no airport on this teeny island, so a plane is out of the question. The ferry to Gozo departs every 30 minutes from Cirkewwa Harbour, which is the northernmost part of Malta. The harbour offers some great views of both Comino and Gozo (great for some photos while waiting for the ferry!), and there are several small boats which depart from here as well, some which can be hired for a private day tour, and some which can take you to Comino. The Gozo ferry takes about 20 minutes to cross the waters separating both islands. This gives you plenty of time for more photos (you are on holiday after all!), and also allows you to admire the beauty of our beloved islands from a nautical point of view.

<strong><u>Landed at Mġarr</u></strong>

As soon you see the Ferry heading into the Harbour, head to your car, and make your way off the boat and onto Gozo. You will be greeted by a Gothic looking church, which looks over the Harbour giving you a sense of protection from above. This church is dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes, and has been welcoming sailors and visitors to the Harbour since 1888. The ride from Mġarr is a steep uphill, and there are some breath-taking views to take in as you go along (Driver safety first and foremost! Drivers should not take their eyes off the road!).

[caption id="attachment_media-8" align="aligncenter" width="4608"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/cittadella_aerial_view_6.jpg" alt="Cittadella_Aerial_View_6.jpg" width="4608" height="2592" /> Citadella, Victoria, Gozo[/caption]

<strong><u>Victoria, Gozo</u></strong>

All roads lead to Victoria! Or Rabat, as us Maltese call it. Gozo’s capital is easily reachable; all you have to do is drive straight on from Mġarr. The Gozitan capital is the busiest part of Gozo, and the most commercial one as well. But don’t let the shops fool you; there is a hidden gem among the narrow streets of Victoria. The Ċittadella is a fortified city situated on top of the highest hill of Victoria, reminiscent of Mdina. Until 1637, the island’s inhabitants were required to spend each night inside the Citadel walls, as there were frequent pirate assaults and kidnappings. There is the magnificent Cathedral which is well-worth a visit, as well as several Museums to see, such as the Museum of Archaeology and of Folklore. Take a look from the Citadel’s walls to behold all of Gozo beneath you!

<strong><em>Interesting fact:</em></strong> There are also fields in the Citadel, which were designed to provide nourishment should the island be kept under siege inside the Citadel for a long time!



[caption id="attachment_media-10" align="aligncenter" width="5948"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/azure_window__dwejra_70.jpg" alt="Azure_Window__Dwejra_70.jpg" width="5948" height="3965" /> Gozo's most famous landmark! The Azure Window[/caption]

<strong><u>Dwejra and the Azure Window</u></strong>

Going on straight through the small village of San Lawrenz, you will behold what is perhaps one of the most recognised images concerning the Maltese Islands. The Azure Window is one of Gozo’s landmarks, forever present on postcards, adverts and brochures. The world-famous window is regrettably falling to its demise, as more and more rock is eroded every year – making the bridge over the window more of a hazard as time goes by. However, admire it while you can, and take as many pictures as you can! The Window can be viewed in all its splendour from a cliff just in front, it is quite a climb; however it is worth every step. Dwejra, where the Window is located, is also famous for its Inland Sea, which is a natural phenomenon occurring when the sea-water from the open sea passes through a small, cave-like crack in the cliffs, and forms a clear-water lagoon just a few minutes away from the Azure Window. The Sea is worth a visit, as there are some boat tours departing from it as well. For a few Euros, you can pass through the small cave like opening and take a tour of the caves of the area, as well as see the gigantic Window from sea-level (Prepare yourself, this will make you feel very, very small!).

[caption id="attachment_media-12" align="aligncenter" width="8192"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_3318.jpg" alt="IMG_3318.JPG" width="8192" height="1812" /> Fungus Rock on the left, Azure Window on the right[/caption]

While going back to your parked car, don’t forget to take a look (and maybe a photo or two!) of the Fungus Rock, an isolated rock in the middle of the sea, which is home to a sporadic plant which the Knights used in many of their medicines.

<strong><em>Interesting fact:</em> </strong>The Knights guarded Fungus Rock day and night to prevent theft of the plants, which is said to have been punishable by death! It is still today illegal to climb the Rock, as it is protected for its wildlife.

[caption id="attachment_media-14" align="aligncenter" width="4608"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ggantija_temple_aerial_view_6.jpg" alt="Ggantija_Temple_Aerial_View_6.JPG" width="4608" height="2592" /> Awe-Inspiring Ggantija Temples[/caption]

<strong><u>Ġgantija Temples</u></strong>

Regaining your breath after the spectacular views at Dwejra, you can head over to the village of Xagħra, home to the neolithic temples of Ġgantija. These temples are the earliest of their kind on our islands, are older than the pyramids of Egypt and are the second oldest manmade religious structures in the world! Walking through, and seeing a structure built more than 5500 years ago, has a way of humbling one somehow.  The tickets are a bit on the pricey side, but it is well worth the money. The temples were constructed before the invention of the wheel, so the builders used stone spheres to transport the immense blocks to their desired place. These spheres are still visible today!

<strong><em>Interesting fact:</em></strong> The word ‘Ġgantija’ in Maltese is a derivative of the word ‘Ġgant’ meaning ‘Giant’, as the Gozitans used to think that the temples were built by a giantess who lived on a diet of broad beans and bread!

[caption id="attachment_1036" align="alignnone" width="4608"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1036" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ramla_lhamra_2.jpg" alt="Ramla_lHamra_2" width="4608" height="3072" /> Ramla l-Hamra - The Red Beach[/caption]

<strong><u>Ramla l-Ħamra Bay</u></strong>

Just a few minutes’ drive away from the majestic temples, down a winding country road, is one of the most beautiful bays of the Maltese Islands. Ramla l-Ħamra Bay is a beautiful stretch of beach, characterised by its striking red sand. The water itself is sometimes dangerous to swim in, as there are a lot of strong currents in the bay – however you can check whether it is safe or not with the Information Centre just off of the bay. If you have kids, they will love building sand-castles in sand that seems like it was made for that purpose. Also, red sandcastles make for some lovely photos! This beach is the perfect place to unwind and relax to the sound of the crashing waves.

<strong><em>Interesting fact: </em></strong>There is a cave near this beach which is said to have been the home of Calypso, the beautiful nymph who held Odysseus with her for 7 years, while he was on his way home from the battle of Troy!

[caption id="attachment_1039" align="aligncenter" width="3260"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/xlendi2.jpg" alt="xlendi2.jpg" width="3260" height="2445" /> Sunset at Xlendi Bay[/caption]

<strong><u>Xlendi Bay</u></strong>

What better place to end your jam-packed Gozo tour, than Xlendi Bay? The bay is a perfect spot to watch the sunset, as the sun seems to melt into the sea just between the two cliff-sides of Xlendi. The bay itself is a quaint little thing, not that great to swim in, especially if you like your beaches sandy. There are some lovely restaurants along the water though, and there is an astonishing walk way, which leads to the edge of the cliffs. The colossal cliffs plunging into the sea make for a great backdrop for a photo as well! The path winds on into a small creek between the cliff faces, where the sea-water makes its way, creating a lovely valley called Kantra.

<strong><em>Interesting fact: </em></strong>The Tower on top of the opposite cliffs over Kantra valley is the oldest freestanding watch tower in Gozo. It was built in 1650 to warn the island of any incoming pirates!

<strong><u>Back to the Motherland</u></strong>

Take a deep breath and inhale all of the beauty that Gozo offered you during this day. There is still much, much more to see, however, we’ll leave that for another day-trip in the future. Our sister island may be small in size, but she is great in character. It is an island full to the brim with hidden splendour, and not-so-hidden gorgeousness as well. Please do your best to keep this untarnished natural beauty as you found it, so that we can visit again and be in awe of all things Gozitan once again. Until next time!

            [content] => Children scream in delight, zooming past with a handful of paper confetti in their hands. Fireworks spiral their way into the air, leaving behind a trail of gleaming light. Band players huff and puff away at their trumpets and trombones, the odd thump from the bass drum echoing. Vendors call out to eager buyers, proudly showing off their wares. The statue of the patron saint looks on, quietly admiring its loyal subjects. The smell of nougat and fresh date cakes fills the air. And to think that this occurrence happens every week during the Maltese summer!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1047" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/enjoying-the-feast.jpg" alt="Enjoying the feast.jpg" width="2848" height="4256" />

The village festa is all this and more. It is a weekly celebration, an all-out festivity which unites (and in some cases divides, but more on that later) the village community. The festa is first and foremost a celebration of the patron saint’s day, and religious commemorations still take place in the beautifully decorated churches. Each town or village has at least one patron saint, with some having two or even three. Each Sunday during the summer, you are guaranteed to find a festa taking place somewhere in Malta. Sometimes there are more than one festa taking place on the same day, especially if the churches are dedicated to the same patron saint. It is a hub of activity, offering something for everyone. Hearty food, plenty of drink and great company are usually at the centre of each festa. It is an intrinsically Mediterranean festivity, combining all the constituents of the traditional Mediterranean character – loud music and cheer, good food, friendly people and a lively atmosphere.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1049" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/feast_decorations_4.jpg" alt="Feast_Decorations_4.jpg" width="3200" height="2119" />

These celebrations date back to the 1500s, when the Knights of St John celebrated a few selected feast days with outdoor festivities. In 1777, Grand Master de Rohan encouraged the Maltese populace to take part and celebrate these religious events with great fanfare, leading up to the jovial affairs they are today. The first celebrated festas used string instruments, and traditional Maltese instruments such as ‘iż-żaqq’, to create a cheery musical atmosphere while celebrating the patron saint. However, these differed greatly from the festas we know and love today. Back then the ‘festa’ was a time when the poor man got to eat like the rich man, all in the name of the patron saint. With the ongoing years, and the decline of poverty in the Maltese islands, the ‘festa’ started to take on another hue. Although food is still quite present during festa time, and there is still some food which is associated typically with the festa, it has now taken a back-seat, and made way to a more lavish festivity. Make sure to enjoy some typical festa food while you’re there – a nougat bar will be a sure-fire hit (and makes for a great souvenir!). Each festa also has its own peculiarities. In Birzebbuga, a seaside village, the statue of the patron saint St. Peter arrives by boat. In St. Julian's and Msida, a greased pole contest entertains spectators. The mast-size slippery pole extends horizontally over the water from a barge and competitors take turns sliding to the end to retrieve a flag, with predictable hilarious results.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1051" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/st_mary_feast_2.jpg" alt="St_Mary_Feast_2.JPG" width="4256" height="2832" />

The main festa festivities take place inside the strikingly decorated churches, dressed to the nines in red damask and gold under-tones. The solemn Mass is consecrated on the Sunday of the festa week, in a service which usually takes place during the late afternoon. Then the procession commences, during which local men haul the patron saint’s statue on their shoulders, and walk through the streets of the town or village, in a sacred commemoration and adoration of the saint it represents. This is all accompanied by an array of clergymen, altar boys and finally by the parish priest. During the procession, the marching band plays holy hymns, as well as one or two hymns dedicated to the patron saint they’re celebrating. The procession generally ends when the statue-carriers arrive at the church parvis, and with a traditional run, carry the statue up the stairs and back into the church. The Maltese still very much cherish this aspect of the festa, although most use it as an excuse to show off their new outfit! However, this solemn part of the festivities still remains at the heart of each festa, even though some other aspects of the festa seem to throw all religious meaning out the door.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1053" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/marsa-marc3.jpg" alt="marsa marc3.jpg" width="960" height="643" />

In stark contrast with the solemnity and sombreness of the religious procession Sunday evening, the usual Sunday morning festivities are characterised by noise, drunkenness and revelry. The ‘marċ’ of Sunday morning is what usually comes in mind when one thinks of a Maltese festa – paper confetti streaming the air, the marching band hollering traditional and local anthems (most of which are clamorous attacks on the rival band club), and oodles of beer! Most towns or villages have at least two band clubs, who, in typical Maltese partisan fashion, are pitted against one another. This results in a mock rivalry that usually ends as soon as the festa week is over. However, it does give the revellers someone or something to insult during the drunken debauchery of Sunday morning. One of the most notorious localities to still have this tenacious rivalry amongst its two band clubs is the town of Ħamrun, where the ‘Tal-Miskina’ and ‘Tat-Tamal’ still keep the rivalry very much alive.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1054" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/hamrun_feast_1.jpg" alt="Hamrun_Feast_1.jpg" width="2592" height="3872" />

Nevertheless, the Sunday morning festivities are truly colourful affairs, full of deafening music and merry people enjoying and celebrating the saint’s day in a truly Mediterranean way. Add a good dose of Maltese summer sunshine to the mix, and you get one of the most unique and characterising aspects of Maltese culture – the Maltese festa. This distinctive feature has helped form the national Maltese character – hard-working people who take their time to commemorate and hold the sacred dear, while also being able to celebrate it in a merry festivity. The festa is an inherent part of our character as Maltese, and year after year, the festas continue to brighten our calendars with their multi-coloured fireworks and their myriad of colours.

            [content] => The ancient people of the Maltese islands had many stories and legends surrounding their history and ancestors. 
		Most of these myths find their foundations in truth and historical facts, although they were then embellished every time they were handed down from generation to generation. Some of these legends are associated with well-known characters in Maltese history, while others are closely knit with popular events of antiquity. There are some characters which pop up in quite a few folktales, and whose adventures differ from one town to the other.

<strong><u>St Paul</u></strong>

St. Paul, who is said to have landed in Malta in the year 60A.D., features in many a legend. One of the many stories surrounding this holy character states that while St Paul and the other members of the crew of the ship were warming themselves by the fire built for them by the Maltese natives, a viper grabbed onto and bit Paul’s hand. The Maltese natives immediately marked Paul as an evil man, who albeit being just saved from the perils of the sea, had to meet his end with a viper’s bite. However, Paul just shook off the (usually) deadly viper and threw it into the flames, carrying on with no apparent injury. The natives, having seen this, were awe-struck, and proclaimed that Paul was a holy man. Legend states that from that day on, all the snakes found in Malta became non-poisonous – something which is true to this day, as no venomous snakes or reptiles are found on the island. A small side note – the above legend has a slightly different ending for many Maltese people, who say that the venom that St Paul removed from the viper was placed in Maltese women’s tongues!

St Paul has a very close connection to Mdina and its neighbouring town of Rabat, where there is a church dedicated to the same saint. This church is said to have been built above the grotto where St Paul lived and prayed in while he was waiting for the ship taking him to Rome to be restored. The Grotto Myth states that the stone, cavernous walls of this grotto had miraculous healing properties, and that no matter how much of it was taken and removed by the devotees visiting the grotto as a memento, it remained unchanged, as if nothing was altered. This Grotto is still a popular spot today, and can be visited through the Church of St Paul in Rabat. The Grotto forms part of a series of many underground catacombs, which stretch underneath Rabat and Mdina. Some of these catacombs, such as those of St Agatha in Rabat, are open to the public and can be visited for a small fee. Another legend based in Mdina, is the legend of St Agatha. In 1551, a group of Turkish invaders launched an attack on Mdina, which at the time was called ‘Citta Notabile’. A nun living in an Mdina nunnery claimed that she saw a vision, where St Agatha instructed her to make a procession around the walls of the city, while holding up a sacred image of the saint. The nun promptly did as she was told, and it is said that the Turks abandoned their attack on the city, and proceeded to raid nearby Gozo instead. We can only imagine how many times poor St Agatha’s name was called out that night – in celebration and in heresy!

<strong><u>Il-Maqluba</u></strong>

Some of the legends created and fabricated by the minds of the uneducated minds of yesteryear were mainly used as explanations of phenomena happening around them. One such phenomenon was the collapsing of a sinkhole in Qrendi, creating a massive crater that the Maltese of the time had no idea how to explain. What was the immense hole in the ground? What made it collapse? And most importantly, how did the chapel of St Matthew remain untarnished, being only metres away from the sinkhole? Old Maltese legend states that the site of ‘Il-Maqluba’, as the sinkhole is called (meaning ‘the upturned’) had been a village in ancient times, a village abounding with evil and sin.  The common belief was that God punished the villagers by wiping their traces off the earth, while leaving a giant crater behind. Both crater and chapel still stand to this day, and can easily be visited while in Qrendi.

<strong><u>Ghosts and Ghouls</u></strong>

Some of the tales of the Maltese are somewhat spookier than others. There are many sayings about the various ghosts that haunt the island, and given the vast history and the countless wars and battles fought on this land, it is to be expected. The main ghost in the Maltese culture is called ‘il-Ħares’, and although there are tales abounding, it was more of a well-known secret than anything else. The predominant Catholic faith did not give lieu to belief in ghosts and spirits, however the Maltese of olden times still kept a strong belief in this ghastly character, and there was many a house which remained empty for years and years, amid rumours of being haunted. One such house can still be seen on the way to Marsaxlokk, a lovely two storey house in the middle of the countryside, still boarded up and empty to this very day. This ‘Ħares’ took different forms, however it was very common in old days to hear a hushed rumour about a Turk ‘Ħares’, who would provide money and gold to the inhabitants of the house, as long as they kept their mouths shut about him. It was said that if the identity of the ‘Ħares’ was discovered, he would not appear again. There are many more legends and stories concerning eerie beings roaming the island, some from the time of the Knights of St John, some about the Turks, the French and even British admirals and soldiers. I’ll let you in on some of these tales, though it is up to you whether to believe them or not!

<em><u>Il-‘ Ħares’ at Fort Ricasoli</u></em>

The Turkish ghost ever present in Maltese tales makes an appearance at Fort Ricasoli, near the Grand Harbour in Valletta. It is said that a worker resting in the Fort was once awakened by this ‘Ħares’, who looked like a Turk. This ghost told the worker about a treasure of golden coins which could be found in the Fort itself. After having been told the location of such treasure, the foolish workman (breaching any unwritten contract with said Turk), rushed off to find his friend to tell him all about the treasure. The two men set off towards the location indicated by the ghost, however when they found the spot, they discovered a heap of coal coins. The ‘Ħares’ is then said to have reappeared during the night, only to beat up the thoughtless workman who had uncovered his secret. The moral behind this ghost story was to never speak of anything the ‘Ħares’ says, which is why all ghost stories in Malta were kept hush.

<em><u>The Headless Bride of Mdina</u></em>

It is said that a heart-broken, headless, ghost bride roams the streets of Mdina at night, warning young men about the sorrows of love. This bride had been promised to marry the love of her life, and had all the preparations for her wedding ready. One night, a lusty Knight captured her and took her against her will. Distraught that her reputation had now been tarnished, she took out her vengeance on him and murdered the brawny Knight. She was sentenced to death by beheading for her (just) crime, although she was granted her final wish of marrying her love before her death. She is said to be still roaming the streets of Mdina after dark, headless but still in her ill-fated wedding dress, a bride that she never truly was, but now always will be.

<em><u>The Blue Lady of Verdala Palace</u></em>

This tale is well-known among the Maltese, and it is wide-spread enough to make the notorious Blue Lady a household name. It is said that the niece of the Grand Master De Rohan had been betrothed to a suitor who she did not fancy, and whom she did not want to marry. He, tired of being ignored and rejected by his future wife, kept her captive in one of the upstairs rooms of the Palace. While trying to escape, she lost her footing, and fell to her death, wearing a blue dress. She is said to still haunt that same room, wearing the same blue dress she wore to her deathbed. One particular incident tells of a guest of the Governor at the time (Verdala Palace used to be the summer residence of the Governor), who slept in her room. He asked the Governor one night who was the lovely lady wearing blue reflecting through the mirror while he dressed, and the servitude replied that they had all seen her. The Blue Lady is one of the most well-known Maltese ghosts, amongst adults and children alike.

The Maltese have always been master storytellers, that’s for sure, from legends about Saints to tales about ghosts – the Maltese have commented on everything and anything. We have always tried to explain the unexplainable, and we have made up some fascinating stories in doing so. The legends now form part of our very being, and share a part of our history, although some are not based on facts. I shall leave it to you to decide whether the ghastly tales of old are true or not, and while you are here, why not try and find out for yourself?

            [content] => Should Jean Parisot de la Vallette awaken from his 500 year old slumber and visit the city he had proudly designed and helped build, (but unfortunately never managed to see), he would surely do a double take and frantically call his architects. The once closed off fortress city now has wide-open gates, which hundreds of people enter daily. Valletta was built as a fortress, but it has become a living work of art, changing with the times and reinventing itself to keep up with the ages. The beauty of it though, is that the new did not eliminate the old; it complements it in a way that makes Valletta a truly unique capital, a city where the Classic walks hand in hand with the Modern.

Built by the Knights of St John from scratch on an untarnished hill, and designed as a defence from future attacks (which thankfully never happened), Valletta was an impenetrable fortress city, with enormous, broad bastions, and an easily-closed off entrance in case of invasion. Today, these bastions still enclose the city, but the once-imposing city gate has been replaced with a cleaner, more modern entrance – comprised of two columns which lead immediately into Republic Street. Entering Valletta is an experience in itself; the awe-inspiring bastions serve as a magnificent backdrop for the hustle and bustle of city life, while crossing the short bridge leading into the heart of the city you will see all kinds of people from all walks of life – hurried office workers, lawyers, shoppers, and tourists, to name but a few. Past the entrance, Valletta opens up into two sides, with two grandiose staircases ascending onto opposite sides of the bastions – one leading to St James Cavalier and the other to St John’s Cavalier and Hastings Gardens.

[caption id="attachment_media-24" align="aligncenter" width="2448"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_3437.jpg" alt="IMG_3437.JPG" width="2448" height="3264" /> Parliament Buiding - Renzo Piano's Modernisation of Valletta[/caption]

Going on into Valletta, a colossal structure will tower over you as you cross the first part of Republic Street. The giant construction, seemingly held afloat on top of miniscule steel beams, is part of Italian architect Renzo Piano’s plan for Valletta’s revamp – and the seat of the Maltese Parliament. Piano’s reconstruction of City Gate, and also his construction of the aforementioned staircases were more or less accepted by the Maltese population; however, the Parliament building has been cause of much speculation and heated arguments among the populace, and has even been nicknamed the “cheese-grater”. Nevertheless, Piano was successful in integrating the traditional with the non-conventional, in creating such a modern masterpiece in the heart of a Baroque city such as Valletta. Beholding the edifice at night is another story altogether. As the warm yellow light lights up the façade as well as the adjoining staircases, you can truly comprehend the fluidity of this Capital. Baroque meets modern, 16<sup>th</sup> Century meets 21<sup>st</sup> Century, Maltese meets foreign.

The beautiful face of Valletta had also been damaged, in some cases beyond repair, after the horrific attacks of World War II, during which Malta, and especially Valletta, played a key role. Being the main port in Malta, Valletta’s harbour and its neighbouring towns were constantly bombarded with air-raids, some of which left considerable damage to the stunning architecture found in the area. One such treasure now lost forever, was the Royal Opera House in Valletta. A stately, ornate building, with a slew of Corinthian columns aligning the entrance, the ‘Teatru Rjal’ was a massive structure, capable of seating 1100 persons. A Luftwaffe bombing in 1942 left the theatre in tatters, with nothing else but ruins in its place.  These ruins were to remain so for many decades, prior to Piano’s renovation project. The theatre’s remnants have now been transformed into an open air theatre, known as ‘Pjazza Teatru Rjal’, or Royal Theatre Square. Several concerts, gigs, shows and plays take place in this revived setting – where once again the contemporary plays well with the bygone.

[caption id="attachment_1087" align="aligncenter" width="3321"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1087" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/battery-street-valletta.jpg" alt="Battery Street, Valletta.jpg" width="3321" height="2157" /> Battery Street - Valletta[/caption]

Valletta has now become a shopping mecca. You can find all the best labels and brands a few metres away from each other, making it a must for anyone looking for some retail therapy. The brightly-lit shop windows line the pedestrianized main streets at eye-level; however there is much more to be seen than just what meets the eye. The National Museum of Archaeology is just a few metres down from City Gate, compressed between modern retail outlets. This building had been the Auberge de Province in the time of the Knights, and it is a fine example of Baroque architecture built in 1571. Here you can see the world-renowned ‘Mara l-Ħoxna’ statue (which translates to the Fat Lady), of which many representations were found scattered throughout the various Neolithic Temples in Malta. This statue is thought to have been a symbol for the fertility cult abounding on the island at that time. There are many more curiosities to find out in this Museum, which is worth a visit.

Another masterpiece in Baroque architecture and in the art of the City itself is the Co-Cathedral of St John, situated a few metres down from the Museum of Archaeology then to the right. This striking monument was commissioned in 1572 by the Grand Master La Vallette himself, as a convent church for the Order. This structure holds many treasures in its’ many chapels, the most famous of which being Caravaggio’s painting ‘The Beheading of St John the Baptist’. Mattia Preti had also been commissioned to work on the interior of the Cathedral, mainly in his depictions of the life of St John. The Cathedral ground is a work of art in itself, where hundreds of marble tombs line the floor creating a patchwork of artwork which you can literally step on. Some renovation works were carried out on the Co-Cathedral to preserve its beauty and splendour; however it has retained the same façade it had when it was redesigned in the 17<sup>th</sup> Century to keep up with the Baroque times.

The Grand Master’s Palace further down on Republic Street had been the seat of administration of the Maltese islands since 1571 until Spring 2015, when the Maltese Parliament was moved to the aforementioned building designed by Renzo Piano. Today, the Palace is home to the office of the President of the Republic of Malta. Today it holds many historical relics which can still be viewed. The square in front of this Palace has been renovated recently as well, and is now open and contemporary. Water fountains sprinkle inviting children to play with them, while comfortable, rounded benches entice tired parents and shoppers to take a rest and enjoy the scenario. This modernized square serves as an excellent backdrop for the remarkable Palace, complementing each other in a harmonious way.

One of the most striking things about Valletta is that no matter how many times it is reborn, revamped, refurbished, it always emerges phoenix-like - brilliant and lustrous, better than ever before. The Modern respectfully tips its hat to the revered Baroque style, integrating itself justly without dominating. Art abounds and architecture flourishes. Jean Parisot de la Vallette would breathe a sigh of relief (the Ottomans have not invaded again after all), and roll over to continue his perpetual sleep.

            [content] => Down by the sea shore where the ferry from Sliema berths along the coastline of Valletta, is a very old building, unseen from the road above, but quietly present and sitting right at the water’s edge. The building has existed for many centuries, constructed at the time of the Knights of the Order of St John and for some time it seems it was also used as a theatre. Eventually it seems its rooms were utilised by the British naval services. Having stood abandoned for several years, it was discovered by its current administrators as a ramshackle, dilapidated and derelict edifice, crumbling into oblivion. Yet, they immediately realised it had the potential for radical transformation.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1175 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_019.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_019.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
Visiting it after the property administrators, Shortlets Malta Ltd directors Franco and Ralph, carried out a thorough restoration, makes it hard to believe that this place could have gone unnoticed, even whilst it is discreetly secluded in its seafront location.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_010.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_010.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
The entrance to this house is adjacent to access to the outdoor area belonging to it – a beautiful ample terrace overlooking the sea. The space doubles up as a pool deck next to a fairly sized swimming pool and a Jacuzzi. A handful of deckchairs stand to attention, invitingly hinting at a siesta, a grand table in black is ready for dining, whilst neatly tucked in a corner is all the equipment required for a mini kitchenette, including cooking space and a dishwasher. This avoids outside cooking from spilling over indoors. Everything is shrouded under the veil of the taller buildings on the side of Valletta, with the full view of the Tigne promontory across the waters.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1178 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_018.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_018.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
A bridge was created to link the terrace to the house itself and after crossing over, one enters to find the first room of the house – a long high ceiling dining space which has a well-equipped kitchen in its far end. Upon closer inspection the kitchen with its white and stainless steel finishes, contains all the requisites for any self-respecting culinary expert. Very well laid out, the kitchen in fact enjoys ample space and a great layout as well as its own breakfast island.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1181" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_057.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_057.jpg" width="1000" height="1499" />
The dining room with its very long glass top table and a series of high-backed white leather chairs, has old fashioned arched windows, large and airy, which look immediately onto the water outside. Its colours offset the rustic limestone aged by time and a turquoise hue runs through the room, from the curtains to the sky and sea outside and back to the valiantly painted antique wooden beams.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1182 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_0111.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_011.jpg" width="1000" height="676" />
To the side of this dining room is an entrance into a spacious and open central area which serves as a living room. With its elegant and fine looking chandelier hanging tall and strong above the room, the living room effectively provides a centralised point for all the people within the house.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1184" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_019.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_019.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
Other rooms radiate from it, namely bedrooms, bathrooms and to the side, a wooden staircase that rises up onto a wooden veranda overlooking the sitting area. This veranda leads into other bedrooms created above this Italian styled ‘soppalco’.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1186" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_027.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_027.jpg" width="1000" height="667" />
The property administrators explain how this wooden construction was ingeniously created in order to make full use of the extremely high vaulted ceiling of this room. Great attention was given to making the parquet soundproof in order to avoid the inconvenience of clacking heels resounding through the house.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1189" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_043.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_043.jpg" width="1000" height="667" />

The bedrooms, which are four in total, come with their ensuite bathrooms, some of which have been created out of exquisitely selected spaces. One of the bathrooms had its surprisingly spacious shower cubicle built into the vaults, and a wall covered with beautifully smooth ‘veneziano’ finish. The finish is found in some of the other rooms, and carries the same blue shade that offsets the generally white furniture well.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1191 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_040.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_040" width="1000" height="667" />

The fact that white has been selected as the base colour, means that all rooms remain fresh and welcoming, whatever other colours in play to boost the décor. Everything had to be carried into the house by hand, all materials and all furnishings, especially in the rooms above the wooden construction. Wood is a key element in this house, so that the original wooden windows were kept intact where possible, or replaced and matched with similarly styled apertures throughout.

The directors, who have had several experiences in the development of other rental properties commented, ‘in our property rental business, budgeting is very important so whenever we invest in new projects we usually have our properties built and finished to specific standard plans including standard finishing and furnishing. Since we rarely deviate from the original plans our projects rarely go out of budget not, and more importantly, do we over-lap our timescales.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1198" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_020.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_020.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
This time round, this property was a new experience for us. To be fair, even before renovation, the house was beautiful, it had a very symmetrical plan and presented itself as a blank canvas, basically a designer’s paradise. Now, becoming emotionally attached to a building is always dangerous when you are budgeting to tight limits but this house was different, all the important lessons we taught ourselves through the years when developing property, namely to stick with the original plan, were somehow ignored. We ended up spending three times more than we originally planned and the house took forever to finish. Every time we visited the house, it seemed to require a bit more attention and a bit more care and we always acquiesced. Luckily, thanks to the skills and hard work of all the people and contractors who worked on this project, all turned out well and the final product is nothing short of extraordinary.’

            [content] => Malta has an extensive history, stretching further back than the ancient pyramids of Egypt, boasting some of the oldest structures in the world. However, although everyone has heard of the pyramids and of Stonehenge, very few people outside of the islands and outside of this field know about our prehistoric heritage. Given that our myriad of temples are some of the best preserved in the whole world, and also that on an area of less than 300km² there are more than 50 of these sites, it is quite bizarre that these sites are still relatively unknown. Thousands of questions still hang in mid-air .. Why were these constructed? Who built them? What kind of technology did these people have? How did they manage to lift the massive menhirs using just manual labour? Why are there so many temple sites on such a small area of land? Why Malta? These are all questions which remain to be answered, and up til now archaeologists and historians could only throw wild guesses as to why and how these were constructed.

During the past few years some other theories have cropped up, hinting that the temple structures might have been used for reasons other than sacred worship of the notorious 'Fat Lady'. In this article we shall explore some of these other alternative approaches, asking questions along the way - questions which might not have an answer yet, but which are compelling in our quest to find out why.


[caption id="attachment_media-4" align="aligncenter" width="2832"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1221" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/hagar_qim_temple_22.jpg" alt="Hagar_Qim_Temple_22.jpg" width="2832" height="4256" /> Hagar Qim Temple, Qrendi[/caption]
<h3 ><em><strong>Observatories</strong></em></h3>
One of the most widely accepted theories regarding the temples (mostly the temples of Hagar Qim and Mnajdra) is that they were constructed with the summer and winter solstices in mind. The south temple of Mnajdra is constructed in a way that on the equinoxes (20th/21st March and 22nd/23rd September) the rising sun aligns with its main axis. During the solstices (21st June and 21st/22nd December) the sun rises in line with the corners of the door jambs, so that only a very narrow beam of light enters the temple. At Hagar Qim on the solstices, sunlight passes through a hole known as the oracle hole onto a chamber on the northern-east side of the temple. Here the sun forms a disc of light onto a stone slab at the entrance to the apse. As the minutes pass the disc becomes a crescent, then elongates into an ellipse, then elongates still further and finally sinks out of sight as though into the ground.


[caption id="attachment_media-6" align="aligncenter" width="6144"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1237" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/hagar_qim_temple_16.jpg" alt="Hagar_Qim_Temple_16.jpg" width="6144" height="4069" /> Hagar Qim Temple, Qrendi[/caption]
We know all this, yet still we know nothing. Why were the temples constructed with the sun's movements in mind? Why was the moving of the sun relevant for these peoples? Was a ritual held on each equinox and solstice? If yes, honouring what/whom?


[caption id="attachment_media-8" align="aligncenter" width="3872"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1241" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/mnajdra_temple_1.jpg" alt="Mnajdra_Temple_1.jpg" width="3872" height="2592" /> Mnajdra Temples, Qrendi[/caption]
<h3 ><em><strong>Sound Chambers/Sound Healing</strong></em></h3>
As if the incidence of the sun's positioning was not curious enough, another theory regarding the temples fuels more interest and more plausibility that these structures were indeed not used as Temples of worship (as we have hastily superimposed) but that they may have served different and much more intricate purposes. Studies have been carried out regarding the frequencies of the stones used in the Temples as well as the frequency of sound in the Hypogeum, an underground structure of a depth of 11m, and spanning over 500m². This frequency results at 111Hz, which coincidentally is the same frequency found in other sacred sites around the world. When the human brain is exposed to this particular frequency, the prefrontal cortex switches off, deactivating the language centre of the brain. The brain then switches from left to right-sided dominance, the side associated with intuition, creativity, and holistic processing and can induce a state of meditation and trance. It is thought that chanting at this frequency in these sites induced a state of meditative trance, through which emotional and social intelligence was increased.

This still raises some questions - how did this ancient people calculate this frequency? Why did they engage in trance-like activities? Was it to create a social unity? Was it part of a much more complicated ritual we are yet to discover? From where did they get this knowledge? Were they just 'troglodytes' as we imagine them, or were they a much more superior race than ourselves?

<em><strong>The Fertility Goddess</strong></em>
Another much lauded theory is that the Temples were built in honour of the fertility goddess, to honour this deity and to hold sacrifices for better harvests. According to Joseph Campbell, who is regarded by many people in the USA as an authority on all ancient mythologies, the "Goddess" religion was an expression of "that primordial attempt on humanity's part to understand and live in harmony with the beauty and wonder of Creation". This cult is thought to have worshipped the feminine form as a creator of life and as a connection to mother earth. The 'fat lady' figure has been found in various archaeological discoveries around the Mediterranean, with several figurines bearing buxom figures, mostly evidently feminine. This sparked the idea that there could have been a Feminine Deity cult around the Mediterranean, which later on developed into Ashtarte, Aphrodite and Isis. When viewed from above, some of Malta's temple structures also resemble this 'Mara l-Hoxna' figure, with semi-circular enclosing forming a seated fat lady figure.

Could this fertility goddess cult be the answer? Were the 'temples' built in her honour? Was this why they bore the same semi-circular shapes? Was this cult spread throughout the Mediterranean?

This article has not done much in terms of shedding light onto the meaning of these Temples, if they even were temples after all. In reality, a big question mark still hangs on these structures, and since writing had not yet been invented, we have little or no way of knowing this civilization's way of life, their traditions, the reason why they built such imposing and massive structures, structures we are still in awe of today - nearly 7000 years later. The 'mystery' of the Maltese temples is as intriguing as any best-selling crime thriller, yet with the added bonus of having took place in a reality many eons ago.
Our search continues, and we shall continue to uncover all we can about these Herculean structures. Until next time!

            [content] => Set among the sprawling hills of Santa Maria Estate in the exclusive location of Mellieha, this four-bedroom, brand new, contemporary villa is the latest addition to Shortletsmalta’s ever-growing repertoire. Always keen on broadening their horizons and breaking all boundaries of limitation, the directors of Shortletsmalta Ltd embarked on an ambitious project – a goal to create a luxury property in one of Malta’s most opulent neighbourhoods. The goal has been achieved, and Shortletsmalta now proudly present Villa Carob Hill.


[caption id="attachment_media-30" align="aligncenter" width="4072"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1300" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simone_mellieha_033.jpg" alt="simone_mellieha_033.jpg" width="4072" height="2703" /> The breath-taking infinity pool[/caption]
This villa features cutting-edge design, including a mixture of clean, crisp lines, minimalist décor, and prestigious materials, which combine to produce a natural flow between the outdoor and indoor areas of the property. The majestic, flexuous staircase leads to the main door of the property, located on the ground floor. The team have strived to transform the ground floor into a space fit for repose, a true relaxation haven. Large glass doors blur the lines between outside and inside, inviting those indoors to the breath-taking pool deck


[caption id="attachment_media-51" align="aligncenter" width="6016"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1325" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simon_0511.jpg" alt="simon_051.jpg" width="6016" height="4016" /> Infinity pool overlooking Mellieha Valley[/caption]
The pool itself beckons you to take a dip, boasting a Zen-like water feature and awe-inducing infinity edges, making you feel like you are truly on top of the world. The view from the pool and the pool deck is spectacular; the entire valley opens up beneath you, and the twinkling Mediterranean can be seen undulating in the distance. The sun-drenched deck offers al fresco dining facilities, as well as sun loungers which enable you to fully relax with the impressive view of the valley and the sea as your back drop.


[caption id="attachment_media-32" align="aligncenter" width="6016"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simon_0551.jpg" alt="simon_055.jpg" width="6016" height="4016" /> Amazing views from the pool deck[/caption]
The ground floor itself is made up of a large open plan kitchen, dining and living area. These areas combine harmoniously to provide a peaceful ambience; natural colours mimic the agrarian surroundings of the valley, while also providing a calm setting for the eyes. The dining and living areas are in turn divided by the state of the art kitchen, which is equipped with all cutlery and crockery.


[caption id="attachment_media-53" align="aligncenter" width="6016"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1327" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simon_028.jpg" alt="simon_028.jpg" width="6016" height="4016" /> Dining Area[/caption]
The lower floors house the four bedrooms and adjoining bathrooms, set apart from the rest of the Villa to provide the tranquillity needed for a good night’s rest. Two of the four bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms, both equipped with a full size bath-tub, for maximum added comfort. The bedrooms also enjoy a terrace of their own, equipped with outdoor furniture. These create a personal oasis of serenity, where one can enjoy the fresh air of the morning, or the still, quiet air of the Maltese night. All bedrooms are fully air-conditioned, and free Wifi is offered throughout the property.

Set apart from the hustle and bustle of city life, nestled in the midst of the Mellieha countryside, this property truly feels like an oasis of calmness amidst the hectic lifestyle of today. If you are looking for a relaxing escape - complete with infinity pool, indoor pool, Jacuzzi and state of the art décor – then look no further. Villa Carob Hill ticks off all of these qualities, and more.

            [content] => Malta has become increasingly popular with expats in recent years. A boom in the Gaming Industry as well as various other job opportunities have opened a new road for foreigners living on our island.  The major part of our population speaks fluent English (it is an official language after all), cost of living is achingly cheap when compared to major European cities, and everything is just a stone's throw away. Forget hour-long commutes to work, it takes a full hour to cross the island from North to South. Boasting jewel coloured waters and the cleanest beaches in Europe, Malta scores high points with youngsters looking to make a living while also living the life. So, what does living in Malta entail?
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1344 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/rental.jpg" alt="rental" width="1920" height="1280" />
<strong>Where to live?</strong>
Renting is always the best option when testing the Maltese waters - it gives you time to see if you like this place after all! There are a myriad of rental properties in Malta, most flocked in the Sliema/St Julian's area, where all the buzz/work/play is. Rental properties in this area vary in price - you really do get what you pay for. There are luxury apartments which will set you back a couple of thousand of Euros each month, and there are also smaller, one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments which are more budget-friendly, in the 500-600 Euro a month range. Take note - rental prices generally do not include utilities, thus you have to make sure to take that into consideration before renting. Utilities (water and electricity) are not the cheapest, but with some attention they won't break the bank either. A big plus is that most rental properties come fully furnished, so all you'd have to do is just move in! Rental properties in other areas of the island tend to cost a bit less than their Sliema/St Julian's counterparts, the main reason being that they are essentially more remote and further away from the 'buzz'. These can be a viable option if you're looking to save your pennies, however beware of travelling times/costs, especially during the summer months when all the buses are jam-packed with tourists.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1370 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/healthcare.jpg" alt="healthcare" width="1920" height="1280" />
<strong>Healthcare</strong>
Malta is ranked one of the best places for healthcare around the world. Maltese citizens receive free healthcare, yet many will also opt to pay for private healthcare insurance, which offers a wider range of services and quicker appointment times. However healthcare quality, even in public hospitals and clinics is truly excellent. The cost of insurance here in Malta is much less than in the rest of the world, compared to countries such as the US. EU citizens residing in Malta are eligible for free healthcare as long as they have an E121 form, with which they can be issued a Certificate of Entitlement. Foreigners outside the EU would need to pay for private insurance.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1384 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/groceries.jpg" alt="groceries.jpg" width="1920" height="1280" />
<strong>Groceries</strong>
Not the most glamorous of subjects, but vital for everyday life nonetheless. Groceries in Malta will not burn a hole in your metaphorical pocket, however it is best to pick and choose your wares. Each town has multiple small grocery shops from where you can get your daily needs, and fairly recently several big chain supermarkets and food stores have started opening shop here in Malta. Discount supermarkets have made a huge hit with the Maltese, with local grocery shops becoming more of a daily necessities hub. Average prices for groceries are as follows:
Loaf of white bread: €.85
Rice (1kg): €1.10
Dozen eggs: €2.05
Milk (1 litre): €0.90
Chicken breasts (1kg): €7.10
Apples (1 kg): €2.00
Tomatoes (1kg): €1.10
Prices are not too high, yet they're not the lowest either. It's best to plan ahead and set a budget for each month so that your Malta experience does not send you overboard.

Eating out is also not the cheapest, but once again depends on which restaurants you choose. Average prices for Malta are thus:
Meal at a mid-range restaurant: €16.00
Meal at an inexpensive restaurant: €9.00
Fast food meal: €7.00
Coca Cola (500ml): €1.25
Cappuccino: €1.50
Bottle of beer (local): €2.10

            [content] => A pile of pumpkins at the local vegetable vendor? Plastic eyeballs and brains centrally displayed in stationery windows? Children gleefully running around dressed in an assortment of costumes? It’s that time of year again.
Halloween has been quite a recent addition to Maltese culture. Coinciding with the Catholic celebr21845ations, All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day, meant that the pagan celebrations of Halloween were put to the side by the majority, who saw it as a holiday that threatened religious traditions and that celebrated the occult.
However, the last five years have seen a rapid change in perception about the holiday, with most of the population now looking forward to Halloween celebrations every year. Children particularly love it, with activities such as trick-or-treating and costume parties becoming a staple for the month of October. While it is still on the way to becoming as established a holiday as Christmas or Carnival, it is undeniable that a Halloween culture is thriving in Malta. This can be easily seen by the myriad of Halloween-themed events occurring over the next two weeks. If you happen to be visiting Malta around this time, and you are into gory things, or into being spooked, why not consider the following events?
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1407 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/paranormal-1170x395.jpg" alt="paranormal-1170x395.jpg" width="1170" height="395" />
<strong>Paranormal Circus </strong>
<strong>Dates: 14<sup>th</sup> October – 13<sup>th</sup> November</strong>
<strong>Location: Manoel Island, Gzira</strong>
<a href="http://www.paranormalcircus.com/malta">Paranormal Circus</a> promises to combine ‘horror’, ‘sexy’, and ‘crazy’ in their 3-hour horror show. This is the Italian company’s second-time running in Malta, back after last year’s incredible success. The tickets start from 10 euros which makes it quite an affordable horror event to go to. If you get too scared or queasy, you can always run out and calm your nerves by sipping (or chugging) a drink at one of the great bars in the vicinity.
<strong>Popeye Haunted Village Night Event (for Adults) </strong>
<strong>Dates: 28/10/2016 – 1/11/2016</strong>
<strong>Location: Popeye Village</strong>
Popeye’s Village is known as one of the most popular tourist attractions in Malta. Instead of the usual tourists with backpacks, these two weeks will be attracting an assorted crowd of blood-covered zombies and eerie-looking ghosts.
<a href="https://popeyemalta.com/packages-menu/seasonal/halloween.html">Halloween for adults in Popeye Village</a> boasts to be the ‘biggest and scariest Halloween event of the year’. The tickets are slightly pricey at €18, which makes it a more expensive activity than the others suggested here. However, this year’s theme, The Dark Ages, looks promising. Keeping in mind that this is an era known for the widespread famine, plague, torture devices, and witchcraft, it is probably worth the few extra euros to explore such an intriguing theme for Halloween.
<strong><img class=" size-full wp-image-1411 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/221014170052-halloween_header.jpg" alt="221014170052--halloween_header.jpg" width="1553" height="640" /></strong>

<h4 ><strong>Popeye Haunted Village for Kids</strong></h4>
<h4 ><strong>Dates: 28/10 2016 – 4/11/2016</strong></h4>
<strong>Location: Popeye Village </strong>
If you have kids and prefer a toned down version of Halloween that can be enjoyed by your youngsters, drop by <a href="https://popeyemalta.com/booking.html?book=38">Popeye Village during the day</a>. The children get to have a fantastic time participating in activities such as haunted mini golf, Halloween treasure hunts, and visiting Olivia’s haunted house. There are also a number of activities that the adults can enjoy alongside the children, such as Spooky Boogie.
The prices are cheaper than the adult version, with children between 3-12 years of age paying €8.50 and adults paying €10.50, making it an affordable family event. If you are not impressed by the Halloween theme, at least you would have visited one of the most popular tourist attractions on the island.
<strong>Pumpkin Feast </strong>
<strong>Date: 30<sup>th</sup> October</strong>
<strong>Location: Manikata</strong>
If you are not into the horror aspects of Halloween but you would still like to experience the Halloween atmosphere, make your way to the north of Malta to partake in the Pumpkin Feast in the village of Manikata. The Pumpkin Feast brings together a wide range of delectable food items containing pumpkin that range from baked pumpkin pasta and vegetarian curried pumpkin rice, to pumpkin jam filled doughnuts. You also get the opportunity to buy pumpkins and fresh vegetables grown by local farmers. If you have children, they can be kept entertained with trick or treat treasure hunts and bouncy castles while you indulge in pumpkin goodness. There is also a free park-and-ride system, which is fantastic if you are considering renting a car and driving there. Manikata is also close to the picturesque beaches, Golden Bay and Għajn Tuffieħa, so this event can be combined with a walk along the coastline where you can absorb the scenic views.
Halloween in Malta? Definitely Yay.

            [content] => Any Maltese history nut, or really any regular patriot, will be quick to point out Malta’s war-stricken past at most given opportunities. From the famous 1565 Great Siege of Malta, to the island’s assistance during the two World Wars, it is safe to say that our ancestors have witnessed a battle or two.

The next battle on the books, though, is a little less bloody. In fact, it comes in the form of a poker tournament, taking place between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> of November! To be precise, we’re talking about The Battle of Malta, organised by PokerListings – a hold’em tournament that is considered to be one of the most inviting in Europe and that has even has been named by the European Poker Awards as the best tournament in Europe with a buy-in that is less than $2000.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1425 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/14022275_1194831560579941_7373739664471628058_n.jpg" alt="14022275_1194831560579941_7373739664471628058_n.jpg" width="960" height="640" />

In fact, the standard buy-in for The Battle of Malta is in the ballpark of €550, with VIP packages exceeding this number quite a bit.  This can seem pricey, especially if you weren’t planning on entering such a tournament at all. However, this actually considered to be a low price for such a large-scale poker tournament. Plus, should you win, €550 will start to feel like change for the bus fare!

Why is this? Quite simply because the 2016 edition of The Battle of Malta has a whopping €1 million prize pool. However, getting a portion of the money is not going to be easy, because there’s a projected attendance of over 2000 people. In other words, if you are interested in participating, make sure that you have some skills to back your game up before Lady Luck shines down on you.

The Battle of Malta wasn’t always this gargantuan, though it certainly didn’t take a long time for it to become so. The first edition took place in 2012, and had a total of 342 participants – which is still considerably impressive for a debut poker event.

It only took another edition for The Battle of Malta to become fully established as Malta’s biggest poker tournament, and it wasn’t long before the rest of Europe caught on either.

In fact, 2014 saw one of the most notable editions of The Battle of Malta, with a prize pool that exceeded €700,000 and a huge influx of professional poker players. Among all the participants, there were over 30 professionals from all over the world. In 2015, the tournament once again broke its own record of attendance with over 1,800 people, and a prize pool of €875,000.

This brought a new edge to the tournament, as The Battle of Malta was always intended to be a people’s tournament – something that any casual poker enthusiast could take part in, and indeed it still is. The fact that you could be rubbing shoulders with some of the biggest shoulders in the game, though, perhaps even beating them if you’re good enough, is quite exhilarating!

So let’s take the discussion to 2016. What can poker fans expect during this year’s edition of The Battle of Malta?  Essentially, an edition that keeps to the tradition of escalating further with every passing year. This will be the first year that The Battle of Malta has a €1,000,000 prize pool, and you can bet that the top 3 players of this year will each win a very, very generous chunk of that pool. In fact, it’s safe to say that they’ll win over €100,000 each.

You can also expect some really interesting side games in addition to the main event, such as the PLO Knights Crusader, BOM Crazy Pineapple, and the Siege of Malta Second Chance.

Like in previous editions, The Battle of Malta 2016 will be taking place at the Portomaso Casino, which is in St Julian’s. The PokerListings’ site still gives you the option of booking a seat, so if you’re up for the challenge, make sure to book as soon as you can!

Of course, there is the possibility that you might end up disappointed, especially if you only heard about the event through us and don’t quite manage to book your place on time. No worries! If you’re craving some casino action, you can do just that at one of the many casinos that are located in Malta, such as the Dragonara Casino, which is also in St Julian’s, and the Oracle Casino in St Paul’s Bay.

If you’re really a diehard poker fan, you might even want to wait for next year’s edition of The Battle of Malta! Why not? Every year has proven itself to be substantially better than the last, and we have no reason to believe that 2017 will be any different!

            [content] => With the Malta Book Festival just around the corner, it’s delightfully easy to get into the spirit of reading. Any bookworm who happens to be in Malta really must take the opportunity to check out the literary genius of a few of our own authors!
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1433 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bookgif.gif" alt="bookgif" width="500" height="281" />
Of course, attempting to tap into our literary culture might be problematic for two main reasons, the first being that if you have no idea of who some of Malta’s most celebrated authors are, you run the risk of missing out on the really good stuff. The other reason is that it’s actually not too easy to come across a Maltese book written in English! Understandably, most of the time Maltese authors choose to stick to their mother tongue.

Don’t give up yet, though! You won’t need to learn Maltese to get an idea of what our literature is like. Because English too is an official language of Malta, there are quite a few gems around. Here is a list of five of our favourite Maltese books in English that you can ask about at the Malta Book Festival, or at your nearest book shop. This list is by no means exclusive, so keep digging for more great titles!
<strong><em>The Secret Life of Nanna Ġenoveffa </em>– Trevor Żahra</strong>

If you ask a random Maltese person who the first Maltese author they can think of is, there’s an extremely high chance that the answer will be Trevor Żahra. With over 130 books published, you can’t really blame them, either. Żahra has written everything under the sun from children’s books to saucier adult novels, and <em>The Secret Life of Nanna Ġenoveffa</em> definitely falls under the latter category.
Though a translation from the original Maltese version (<em>Il-Ħajja Sigrieta Tan-Nanna Ġenoveffa</em>), none of the humour and clever use of language is lost in the English version. The story revolves around a manuscript found by the grandson of Nanna (Grandmother) Ġenoveffa – a manuscript that is definitely not for young eyes.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1437" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/booksgif2.gif" alt="booksgif2.gif" width="235" height="317" />
Offering an introspective take on the quiet roles Maltese women were expected to lead just a few generations back, Ġenoveffa’s story is full of hilarious sexual exploits, but the story is balanced out with the right amount of taste and emotive, relatable characters. Żahra’s short novel does what few novels manage to do as exceedingly well, which is tug on your heartstrings while making you chuckle at light-hearted naughtiness.
<strong><em>Two</em> - Teodor Relijc             </strong>
<em>Two</em> is Reljic’s debut novel, but it’s such a good read that you probably wouldn’t have realised unless we told you! The novel is about a family on holiday in Malta. Elizabeth, the mother, falls into a coma with little sign of recovery; the rest of the family is in shock.
As a means of coping, her son William, recalls the stories his mother would tell him when he was younger. When a stranger appears, he is given reason to believe that her stories aren’t just make-believe, and that there is a lot more to his mother than he initially thought.

We won’t give too much away from this captivating story! However, we will say that Reljic has managed to create a work that is emotionally engaging while also making use of Maltese folk traditions in a subtle, subversive way.
<strong>Several works by Francis Ebejer</strong>
We refuse to recommend any one title by Ebejer because the man is one of those iconic Maltese writers that any literature enthusiast needs to explore in more depth. A dramatist as well as a novelist, Ebejer’s works are often tackled more academically by university students.

That doesn’t mean that the casual reader won’t enjoy his writing! However, to appreciate Ebejer fully one does need to appreciate that Ebejer was avant-garde in the context of Maltese writing. Alongside many other techniques, he was known for using absurdity to demolish established social and literary traditions in Malta. Indeed, though his stories are set in the island, Ebejer explores themes that are very much universal.

Some of his English novels include <em>A Wreath of Maltese Innocents</em> (1958), <em>Wild Spell of Summer</em> (1968), <em>In the Eye of the Sun</em> (1969), <em>Come Again in Spring: Requiem for a Malta Fascist</em> (1980), <em>Leap of Malta Dolphins </em>(1982), and <em>The Malta Baron and I Lucian</em> (2002 – published posthumously).
<strong><em>What Happens in Brussels Stays in Brussels</em> - Guze Stagno
</strong>
One of Malta’s more prolific writers in recent years, Stagno is no stranger to controversy as a result of him not being afraid to speak his mind in writing. In other words, don’t expect safe, clean storytelling here!
An effortless read, Stagno’s novel is a must-read because it manages to fuse a great plot with relevant social commentary. Essentially, the novel can be seen as a take on all kinds of Maltese stereotypes, and how they are accentuated when taken out of the homeland. All in all, <em>What happens in Brussels Stays in Brussels </em>is a great way of getting to know the Maltese way of doing things in a brutally honest way.

<strong><em>Barefoot in the Saltpans</em> – Daniel Massa</strong>
This recommendation is for the poetry fans! Daniel Massa is a highly celebrated Maltese poet for his writings in Maltese as well as in English. His latest collection, <em>Barefoot in the Saltpans</em>, simply validates that celebration further.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1439" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/booksgif3.gif" alt="booksgif3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
The poems here are centred around seascapes, and the visceral, raw responses that are generated from being caught in the midst of such physical grandeur.

The Malta Book Festival has become a yearly appointment, with every year bringing a bigger crowd, and a better, more varied programme. Here are 6 reasons why you should be navigating the labyrinthine streets of Valletta down to the Mediterranean Conference Centre from the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> of November:

<ol >
	<li>Not a book fair</li>
</ol>
Don’t get me wrong. Book fairs are great – you get to walk around and buy a pile of books for less money than you would normally pay. But the Malta National Book Festival is more than that. While it did start off as a book fair, in 2013 it underwent a rebranding from the concept of a commercial book fair, to a National Book Festival. There is still a commercial aspect to it, as you can obviously still go and buy books at bargain prices. However, adding to that commercial element is a programme nuanced with educational and cultural activities, making it a far more interesting visit than your typical book fair. The programme is varied enough to be enjoyed by both the very young and old, with children’s activities such as tracing and colouring activities of their favourite characters occurring alongside more adult activities such as exhibitions and conferences.

<ol  start="2">
	<li>Putting Faces to Names (or Names to Faces)</li>
</ol>
The National Book Festival has always been known to gather a diverse number of authors under one roof, intent on promoting their works of art. This year will be no different, with local, eminent authors such as Maria Grech Ganado, whose name is emblazoned on every local student’s list of books to read, having a whole evening dedicated to her and her life’s work. There are also a number of well-known foreign authors that will be participating in this year’s festival, such as the British writer Patrick McGuinness, the Bulgarian satirical writer Alek Popov, and the Egyptian novelist Basma Abdel Aziz. These three brilliant authors will be present at various stages of the festival, with the highlight being their participation in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1755171114748146/">conference on Literature and Totalitarianism</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1755171114748146/">,</a> that will be occurring on Wednesday evening. The conference, along with other similar events, should be a great opportunity for the public to engage in discussions with some of the greatest literary minds of the contemporary age.

<ol  start="3">
	<li>Foreign Literature</li>
</ol>
While you would associate the National book Festival, with national literature, the Malta Book Festival also offers an insight into foreign literature and authors. Of particular note this year is a presentation titled ‘Cervantes and Don Quixote in Literature and Culture’, which commemorates the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the writer’s death. Interestingly, there will be some Maltese elements added to the mix with Emmanuel Abela, a popular folk singer, singing excerpts from the Maltese translation of Cervantes’s work.

<ol  start="4">
	<li>Bookbinding Exhibition</li>
</ol>

Let’s face it, how many times have you stopped and thought about the binding process of a book? Probably never. Which is why you need to visit this year’s thematic exhibition on the fascinating subject of book-binding. The exhibition, that will be located within the Perello Suite of the Mediterranean Conference Centre, contains displays of handmade books as well as the opportunity to engage in discussions and workshops on the construction of a codex.

If you are someone who is perhaps more into films than books, you are in luck. Saturday evening will feature a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1786010594974873/">short film premiere</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1786010594974873/">,</a> featuring the short story adaptation titled ‘Il-Komplici’ from the collection of short stories ‘lura d-dar u grajjiet ohra li ma grawx’ by Walid Nabhan. The event is open to all, and it presents the opportunity to meet Ryan Gatt who is the young film director, as well as the writer who authored the collection of stories. The event certainly promises an interesting and provoking discussion on literary adaptation into film.

Do you think you will get bored of talks on books and films? Don’t worry, you can tune out the literary talk and use this festival as an opportunity to tour the baroque building where it will be hosted. Built in 1574, during the reign of Grad Master Jean de la Cassiere, the hall measures 155 metres in length and was at the time, one of the largest halls in Europe. It is the former ‘Sacra Infermeria’ of the Knights of St John, which was considered to be one of the best hospitals in Europe, and could accommodate as many as 914 patients in an emergency.
Best of all? The entrance is free of charge. Beware, however, you’ll probably have an empty wallet, a heavy bag of books, and a contented smile by the end of the night.
You can view the full programme of the festival here: http://ktieb.org.mt/?p=2662

            [content] => Even if you’re unfamiliar with the Maltese tongue, you may have noticed that some words roll off the tongue in the most delightful way. When this happens, you can bet that those words mean something that is equally delightful. Take ŻiguŻajg, for example. Say it slowly; utter each syllable. Isn’t it a gorgeous word? What on earth could it mean?
The definition is even more wonderful than the word itself! ŻiguŻajg is an International Arts Festival taking place between the 11<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> of November, aimed at children and young adults organised by Fondazzjoni Kreattiva, with the scope of inspiring young minds to fall in love with art of all forms.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1470" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg1.gif" alt="ziguzajg1.gif" width="298" height="167" />
We really do mean all art forms! From theatre productions and film showings, to art exhibitions and poetry readings, and basically anything else you can possibly think of and more, ŻiguŻajg is the perfect space to get your creativity pumping. Quite a few of the shows and exhibitions here are interactive, too, giving children a great opportunity to participate in creative spaces.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1473" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg2.gif" alt="ziguzajg2.gif" width="480" height="362" />
In fact, ŻiguŻajg is such a stellar introduction to the arts that Maltese schools use the festival as an opportunity to take their students out on field trips. Of course, even though the shows here are geared to younger audiences, anyone will be able to appreciate the intellect and effort that goes into making these ideas a very artistic reality.
We’ve hyped you up enough – let’s get into the details so that you and the kids in your life can experience ŻiguŻajg for yourselves! As in previous years, all the events that form part of the festival will be taking place in Valletta, which only further validates its position as the cultural capital of Europe in 2018.
So how do you get your tickets for ŻiguŻajg? There are two ways – the first, and perhaps the easiest, is to get them directly from <a href="http://www.ziguzajg.org">www.ziguzajg.org</a> (note the lack of Maltese letters). The other is to purchase them from the St James Cavalier box office.
Now, it’s important to understand that you won’t be buying a block ticket for the whole festival – you’ll be buying individual tickets for individual events. This isn’t a problem because each ticket costs only a measly €2, meaning that attending ŻiguŻajg is unlikely to put a dent in your wallet. However, it does mean that you really need to do your homework to make sure you’re buying tickets for the shows you truly want to see from all the available ones.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1476" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg3.gif" alt="ziguzajg3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Browsing through all the events might seem very daunting – how do you possibly begin? Luckily, ŻiguŻajg’s website is very comprehensive, and gives you a detailed list of every single show. It even lets you browse by selecting different age categories, including 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, and 13+.
If you still need some help, we’ve gone through the list ourselves and took note some of the shows that we thought would be particularly interesting. That doesn’t mean that these are the only shows worth watching! Actually, that couldn’t be further from the truth, but if we chose every single show we wanted to see this blog post would never end! So without further ado, here are some our ŻiguŻajg choice cuts:
<strong>Discover Valletta</strong>
For anyone unfamiliar with Malta’s capital, <strong>Discover Valletta</strong> is a must. An audio-tour of sorts, presented by leading author Trevor Żahra no less, this is a great way to visit 24 locations around the capital and learn all about them in a colourful and engaging way. No, it’s not just a history lesson – it’s also a great way to experience digital storytelling!
<strong>Stick Stones Broken Bones</strong>
Taking place at San Gorg Preca College, <strong>Stick Stones Broken Bones</strong> is a comedy show consisting of shadow puppets! Aimed at children aged 7 and over, the show has a real surrealist feel amidst the side-stitching humour. You don’t need to take our word for it, either – the show has been performed worldwide to great success!

There will also be accompanying workshops for those who want to further immerse themselves in the spirit of creativity!
<strong>
</strong><strong>Starlet</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1479" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg4.gif" alt="ziguzajg4.gif" width="300" height="225" />
If you don’t understand a lick of Maltese, it’s understandable that you might be worried about adopting a blank face when watching some of the shows at ŻiguŻajg. Though several of the productions are in English, Starlet – which takes place at the City Studio Theatre – eliminates the worry further by being a non-verbal theatre show!
Great for the little ones, Starlet is about two explorers who happen to be both time travellers as well as space explorers. Their rocket malfunctions, leading them to land on the moon. They end up befriending a small star, Starlet, and the rest of the production revolves around the heroic act of trying to get her home.

            [content] => We’ve all been there. We’ve all sat down in front of the cinema screen, or the television, gazed in awe at a particularly breath-taking scene, and made a mental note to visit that idyllic beach, quaint city or historic fort. While making those mental notes, Malta would have probably been far from your mind for places to visit.
But it shouldn’t have been. Disguised as the south of France, Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, and a myriad of other locations, Malta has featured far more than you think in films.  With its blend of a rugged coastline, ancient majestic buildings, and picturesque beaches, it has been a prime location for film makers for decades.
Let’s take a trip down memory lane, and relive some film scenes and their locations.


<h2 >World War Z (2013) , Valletta</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1485 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/worldwarz.jpg" alt="worldwarz.jpg" width="618" height="348" />
World War Z, an American action horror film directed by Marc Foster features a zombie pandemic that Gerry, a retired United Nations investigator is trying to put a stop to.  One of the most vivid scenes of the film is when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpJoMuuE3Eg">Gerry visits Jerusalem</a> and encounters a crowd of people inside the walled city chanting and singing. The noise attracts the walking corpses and they pile themselves on top of each other until they manage to jump over the wall into the crowd.  As the zombies fall over the wall by the dozens, into the midst of the crowd, the panicked crowd starts running down the strangely familiar narrow streets filled with wide shallow steps. It is not Jerusalem, but none other than Malta’s very own capital city, Valletta. Some scenes also feature Fort St Elmo in Valletta, a fort which had a crucial role in the Great Siege of 1565. Valletta is set to be European Capital of Culture in 2018, which means that there currently are <a href="http://valletta2018.org/events/">various cultural events</a> happening in the city, making it a great location to visit (or revisit).


<h2 >By the Sea (2015), Mġarr ix-Xini</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1488 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/mgarrixxini.jpg" alt="mgarrixxini.jpg" width="640" height="350" />
Described as a romantic drama, the film featuring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did not get rave reviews from film critics, who lambasted the film for its narrative shortcomings. What definitely cannot be criticised is their choice of filming location, putting a spotlight on one of the best beaches in Gozo. Mġarr ix-Xini, disguised as the south of France in the film, is truly idyllic, situated in a deep valley and has crystal-clear water. Since it is more difficult to get to than other beaches such as Ramla l-Ħamra, it is usually peaceful, with only a few locals in the area, along with some divers. Now that the weather is cooler, it is ideal to combine the trip to the beach with a walk to Mġarr ix-Xini tower, which is the largest of the coastal watchtowers that the Knights of Malta erected on the island of Gozo.


<h2 >Troy (2004) , Blue Lagoon</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1491 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bluelagoon.jpg" alt="bluelagoon.jpg" width="400" height="271" />
Troy, the epic adventure war film released in 2004 is loosely based on Homer’s Iliad. Also starring Brad Pitt, it was definitely a far more successful film than By The Sea, reaching the top box office hits and was the 8<sup>th</sup> highest-grossing film of 2004.  The set for the city of Troy itself was built at Fort Ricasoli, which was built by the Knights of St John in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. However, some of the most memorable scenes were shot in one of the top tourist spots in Malta : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf5H0l3GMtk">The Blue Lagoon</a>. Situated on the tiny island of Comino, the long and narrow bay is ideal for a number of activities like swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving, and it is only 25 minutes away by boat from Ċirkewwa.


<h2 >Game of Thrones (2011), Azure Window</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1494 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/azurewindow.jpg" alt="azurewindow.jpg" width="650" height="365" />
The first season of the wildly successful HBO series was shot in Malta, with locations ranging from historic buildings such as Fort St Angelo and Fort Ricasoli, to convents and private gardens. A particularly important location for this series was Mdina, with its gated entrance being highly visible during some of the scenes. Lord Peter Baelish’s brothel is also a building that you can find tucked away in a corner while walking the streets of Mdina.
However, the most memorable location of all was the Azure Window in Dwejra, Gozo that featured as a backdrop to the Dothraki Wedding. The setting crimson sun behind the Azure Window as Khal Drogo and Daenerys hold their wedding ceremony is truly impressive, to the point that fans of the series have flocked to the sister island of Malta to use the same backdrop for their wedding photos. If you also want to frame the perfect wedding picture best be swift about it. Experts are saying that it won’t be long before the eroding window collapses. While you’re there, you can make your way to the other side of Dwejra, known as the inland sea. For just 4 euros, you can take a boat ride that passes near the Azure Window, giving you a great view of the majestic formation up close.

            [content] => Now that winter is at our doorstep and the temperatures are getting colder, people tend to turn to alcohol to bring some warmth to their face and hands. If you are in Malta, or planning to get here soon, you might want to stay away from your traditional whiskies and wines, and try something more unique. The following are Maltese liqueurs worth considering:

<h2 >Bajtra Liqueur</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bajtra.jpg" alt="bajtra.jpg" width="600" height="800" />
The bajtra (pronounced ‘baitra’) is the prickly pear, a tree that thrives on the Maltese islands. Prickly pear trees were originally popular because farmers planted them to act as windbreakers and also to bar access from one field to another, serving as a deterrent to most wanderers. However, it also became popular due to the belief that it contains medicinal properties, with prickly pears being used to treat a vast array of ailments, ranging from insect stings to stomach aches. August is usually the harvest season of prickly pears, with locals eating the sweet, refreshing prickly pear fruit by the dozens.
It stands to reason that the abundant prickly pears were put to better use by forming a sweet-tasting liqueur, perfect for an aperitif or an after-dinner drink to round up the day. The Bajtra Liqueur is best served chilled, with no ice added to it.


<h2 >Rummiena Liqueur</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/rummiena.jpg" alt="rummiena.jpg" width="640" height="480" />

The Pomegranate tree (Rummiena) is also found in abundance on the Maltese islands. While it is not indigenous to the island, it was introduced centuries ago and thrived in this climate. Like the prickly pear, the pomegranate has also been considered to contain healing properties. A number of shrines dedicated to Il-Madonna tar-Rummiena (Our Lady of the Pomegranate) reveal another association with this crimson fruit: abundance.
The Maltese liqueur produced from local pomegranate provides all the sweet and tart flavours that make the crimson fruit so unique. Best served chilled, on the rocks, or as a base for any creative cocktails you can come up with. Sit down and get your cogs turning!


<h2 >Ħarruba Liqueur</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/harruba.jpg" alt="harruba.jpg" width="480" height="640" />

The carob tree (il-Ħarruba) has been an integral part of Maltese vegetation for centuries. Due to its ability to survive on little water and with no cultivation, it is quite a common tree in Malta. The fruit’s beans and pods have had a variety of uses. During World War II, the beans formed part of the diet of the locals who were slowly starving to death due to a food shortage.  Up until fairly recently, carob beans were crushed and boiled to produce a syrupy liquid, which was then used for sore throats and coughs. The carob pods are still used to this day to make carob sweets (karamelli), by mixing carob pods and honey until caramelised. These small brown squares of healthy goodness are usually available during Good Friday processions, as they are the only sweets allowed during Lent.
The Ħarruba liqueur is only another way of enjoying the sweet taste of carobs. This liqueur can be served chilled, on the rocks, or also neat, and it is best served after a meal, to close on a sweet note.


<h2 >Limunċell</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1514" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/lumija.jpg" alt="lumija.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

The Limunċell is the Maltese version of the popular Italian Limoncello, a liqueur made from local lemons. Its zesty taste is the perfect end to a meal.
If you would like to try something different, and make your own limuncell, drop by The Limestone Heritage, Park and Gardens in Siggiewi. One of their venues is a citrus garden, where guests are allowed to participate in <a href="http://limestoneheritage.com/limoncello-making/">making limuncell</a>. First, the visitors are given a detailed demonstration. Then, fresh lemons are picked from the trees and the zest peeled off. This is then put into jars and immersed in alcohol, ready to be stored for two weeks. The peeled lemons are used to make refreshing lemonade and lemon sorbet, with lemonade and limuncell shots being served to guests during this activity.

All these bottles of liqueur cost less than €20, making it an affordable memento to carry back home with you. Moreover, the sturdy, cleverly designed packaging of most of these liqueurs make them ideal souvenirs for your loved ones back home.

            [content] => Not everyone is in Malta for the same length of time, but whether you’re visiting our little island for a week or three months, it is definitely recommended that you learn at least a smidgen of Maltese to make your holiday more pleasurable.
There are plenty of reasons why taking this route is a good idea. For starters, even though Malta is a bilingual nation and most people here will be able to communicate in English just fine, locals will appreciate your efforts in speaking the mother tongue! We really do think it’s charming when tourists have a go at speaking Maltese, so you might be rewarded with some extra hospitality.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1521" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven1.gif" alt="seven1.gif" width="384" height="270" />
Plus, there’s always the fact that learning a new language is simply a rewarding, enriching experience for its own sake – and if you plan on learning more languages, Maltese is a great option. Sure, we might not have the most widely-spoken language in the world, but it sure makes for a good challenge. Our unique blend of Italian, Arabic, and other influences is not the easiest to get to grips with, mark our words, but that’s what makes it fun!
Of course, if you do use your Maltese skills to practical use, you need to make it very clear that you’re still an apprentice of the tongue. Most people will pick up on this easily, but if your accent is convincing enough, you might that some people will try to carry a whole conversation in Maltese with you!

Still, at least starting the conversation in Maltese is sure to turn some heads, guaranteeing that it will be pretty easy to get the help and/or information you need as you explore the island. So without further ado, here are a few essential phrases that you can use to impress the Maltese, and even your friends back home!
<strong><u>Bonġu/Bonswa </u></strong><u>(Good morning/Good evening)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1523" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven2.gif" alt="seven2.gif" width="450" height="268" />
[Pronounced: bon-joo/bon-sua] When trying to get someone’s attention, nothing works quite as well as a heartfelt greeting. Even if you switch to English right after, a good Bonġu from a non-Maltese native will definitely put a smile on anyone’s face. In other words, you might actually make his morning good!
<strong><u>Kif int?</u></strong><u> (How are you?)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1525" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven3.gif" alt="seven3.gif" width="640" height="446" />
[Pronounced: keef-int?] The same principle as above stands here. Whether you’re looking for guidance, or whether you’re simply trying to have a chat, showing interest in the other person’s well-being goes a long way. Human compassion is a language that transcends words, but hey – it works pretty well in Maltese too.
<strong><u>X’jismek?/ Jiena jisimni… </u></strong><u>(What is your name? /My name is….)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1527" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven4.gif" alt="seven4.gif" width="500" height="282" />
[Pronounced: shyis-mac?/yeena yisimni] You can’t make friends with people if you don’t know their names, right? Going abroad is rewarding for so many reasons, but connecting with new people is definitely one of our favourites. Using these two simple phrases might result in you making some genuine friends you’ll come to regard as irreplaceable.
<strong><u>Kif nista mmur sa…? </u></strong><u>(How can I get to [insert place here]?)</u>
[Pronounced: keef nista immoor sa..?] Malta might be a maze for you, but you can at least show those around you that your grasp on the language is slightly less labyrinthine! We bet that you wouldn’t want to receive directions in Maltese back, though!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1529" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven5.gif" alt="seven5.gif" width="500" height="251" />
Pro tip: If you really want to impress, learn how to use the determiner article <em>il- </em>works in Maltese. If you want to go to any library, you’d say ‘Kif nista mmur sa librerija?’. However, you want to go to a specific one, you’d say ‘kif nista mmur sal-librerija?’. Place names don’t require the article, so you can just say sentences like ‘kif nista mmur sa Ħaġar Qim?’
<strong><u>Jekk jogħġbok/Grazzi</u></strong><u> (Please/Thank you)</u>
[Pronounced: yekk yodgbok/gratsi] We teach children that these are life’s magic words all over the word, and it’s equally true in Malta. Have you ever been to a concert or a similar production featuring a foreign artist, and hearing the performer say thank you in your own language?
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1531" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven6.gif" alt="seven6.gif" width="480" height="360" />
We tend to love it here, so if you make using these two words a habit, you’ll be in everybody’s good books.
<strong><u>Tista terga tirrepeti? </u></strong><u>(Could you repeat?)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1533" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven7.gif" alt="seven7.gif" width="443" height="211" />
[Pronounced: tista terdga tirrepeti?] Here’s a fun one that you’ll definitely need to use at some point, especially if you’re making an extra effort to carry the conversation in Maltese. However, it might come in handy even if the other person is speaking in English with a challenging accent. Don’t worry about asking this question – we won’t bite your head off.
<strong>Inħobbok/Inħobbkom</strong> (I love you [singular] /I love you [plural])
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1535" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven8.gif" alt="seven8.gif" width="500" height="366" />
[Pronounced: eenhobbok/eenhobbkom] Whether you’re trying to make your romantic holiday in Malta even more romantic, or whether you’re simply trying to extend some real appreciation to family and Maltese friends, nothing goes down a treat quite like love.
<strong><em>Pronunciation notes: </em></strong>
<em><strong>'dg'</strong> = a hard G sound,  like the 'G' in 'Roger'</em>
<em><strong>'ts'</strong> = a soft Z sound, like the 'z' in 'Pizza'</em>
<em><strong>'x'</strong> in Maltese is equivalent to 'sh'</em>
<em><strong>'h'</strong> in Maltese is equivalent to an 'h' sound like in 'happy'</em>
<em><strong>'gh'</strong> in Maltese is silent, it only lengthens the vowels</em>
<em><strong>'j'</strong> in Maltese is equivalent to 'y'</em>

<h3>Wied iż-Żurrieq</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7djPFDsKn/



Definitely one of the most captivating views on the island, Il-Wied is the epitome of photogeneity. Crystal blue waters and rock formations galore, you won’t need any filters when snapping this fantastic location.

<h3>Mdina</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7JISDhdrf/



The winding narrow streets and Medieval architecture make for some pretty gorgeous pictures, and it seems that the more you explore the meandering streets of our old Capital, the more quaint and scenic they become. Make sure to look out for traditional Maltese doorknobs, which are still abundant on the doors of Mdina.

<h3>Popeye Village, Mellieha</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM6iKxSjWwG/



Built in the 1980s as a film set for the movie starring Robin Williams as the world’s most loved sailor, Popeye Village has been transformed into a park for kids. However, it still remains one of the most charming spots on the island, which just happens to look even better on camera!

<h3>Fomm ir-Rih</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BKYY1Nggn0L/



Off the beaten track, yet never disappoints – Fomm ir-Riħ offers incredible sea and country views, perfect for photography enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With white cliffs plunging dramatically into the ethereal turquoise sea, and a teeny stretch of beach (which is laboriously arduous to get to), you can get different yet brilliant scenarios for your snaps. Once again, no filter needed.

<h3>Mellieha</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM12eWCA_56/



One of Malta’s oldest and most beloved villages, Mellieħa is chock full of Instagrammable locations – from the awe-inspiring Sanctuary to the notorious Għadira Bay, so you can literally have your pick and capture a bit of everything. Make sure to check out the view from the Main Square!

<h3>Marsaxlokk</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BMuVTUXjXPT/



Malta’s most colourful village! Marsaxlokk is a burst of colour which will absolutely liven up your photos, from the multi-coloured Luzzu boats with their traditional blue, yellow, red and white hues, to the brightly pigmented facades which adorn the coastline. No need to fix Saturation levels here!

<h3>Gnejna Bay</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BMyy_6tDyMf/



With views that stretch over to the nearby island of Gozo, warm reddish sand and crystalline blue sea, it is obvious that Ġnejna Bay would be included in this list. Head there when the sun is setting on a clear day to capture splendid sunset snapshots. Make sure that you’re not too distracted by the blazing sun seemingly melt into the Mediterranean, and keep your camera/phone handy!

<h3>Jerma Palace Hotel Ruins, Marsascala</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BE5UObKvPO_/



Despite being a derelict hotel, left to ruin at the mercy of the elements, this structure has become a graffiti paradise, boasting some of Malta’s best street art. It is not a typical touristy location, and it is currently still in ruins, yet a walk around the Jerma Palace area in Marsascala can uncover some very photogenic aspects of Malta which are uncommon. Best for urban photographers who love their share of street art!



https://www.instagram.com/p/BIVGbZtBHGh/

<h3>St Peter’s Pool, Marsaxlokk</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BLQmoadAO2f/



St. Peter’s Pool is one of three creeks found in the Marsaxlokk area, and undoubtedly it has become the most famous of the three. And it is easy to see why. Yellowish white rocks frame the dazzling aquamarine sea, forming a perfect crescent – which in turn forms perfect photographs! Look out for the various names and sayings etched out in the pliable rock for an added oomph to your photos.



https://www.instagram.com/p/BJvK3rKjSvo/
<h3></h3>
<h3>Valletta</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM6Y4VZg4Xb/



No list can be complete without a mention of our most photogenic location of all, our pride and glory, our capital Valletta. There is literally a photo opportunity around every single corner (you’ll find corners a-plenty in this grid-like city) – from architectural features to impressive seaviews, quaint shops to quirky people – Valletta is a pivot of all things Maltese, and a strikingly beautiful one too. Take a stroll around its streets and snap away, you’ll find inspiration oozing out of every stone.

            [content] => 21<sup>st</sup> December marks the official shift to winter, and although we’re still more or less a month away from that date, it’s important to know what to expect if you’ll be spending at least some of your winter time in Malta.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/winter2.gif" alt="winter2.gif" width="500" height="281" />

We don’t hear much about Maltese winter, do we? All the magazines and blogs seem to advertise our unmatchable summers. It seems that our little island has taken the title of ‘sunny Malta’ for so long that visiting the island in any other kind of weather can be a bit of a let-down for some. However, the truth is that winter in Malta has its charm too, although it might not be obvious from the start if you were expecting summer vibes in December and January.

Plus, in the end, it kind of depends on what your definition of a charming winter is. If you’re dead set on getting metaphorically lost in mountains and mountains of snow during the winter time, you should probably pick another season to visit the island, where you can get acquainted with the typical ‘sunny Malta’.
For those of you ready to take the road less travelled and opt to experience winter in Malta, here’s a small list of what to expect.
<strong>How cold does it get?</strong>
Winter here can be fun for people who like guessing games. Malta’s weather tends to be pretty unpredictable as soon as summer says its final goodbyes and Autumn starts creeping in. Once winter arrives, the unpredictability continues.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1573" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/winter3.gif" alt="winter3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
The fact of the matter is that as far as coldness goes, Maltese winters are really mild, on the whole. There’s often quite a bit of sunniness to go around, and wearing short sleeves at the Christmas lunch table is not uncommon at all.
Don’t be too quick to only pack t-shirts, though, as it can also get really cold here, especially at night. Granted, it might not get as cold as it does in other parts of the world (no snow means we don’t really get to sub-zero temperatures), but you’ll usually be grateful you remembered to bring a jacket! Plus, we can get some pretty heavy winds here, which you’ll definitely need some armour for.
<strong>What is the rain like in winter?</strong>
Don’t expect it to rain every day in Malta, but when it does rain it tends to pour. The general pattern is one or two weeks of no rain, followed by a pretty heavy outpouring that can last the whole day (if not two days).
The reality is that sometimes the rain here seems worse than it actually is. Why? For two main reasons:

<strong>1) Flooding:</strong> In Malta, you don’t need to worry about water rising to the top floor of your home, but quite a few areas in Malta are prone to flooding, such as Msida and Birkirkara. It’s recommended that you avoid these areas, and similar areas, during heavy rains as much as possible. Although it’s unlikely that floods will reach dangerous levels, it’s best to always be cautious.
<strong>2) Traffic jams: </strong>For inexplicable reasons, the traffic situation in Malta tends to worsen as soon as rain occurs. To be fair, we reckon that fears of flooding might have something to do with it, but you will notice this to be case even during light drizzles. If you find yourself caught in traffic while exploring the island, have some patience. All the places you wanted to go to in Malta are still worth going to!

<strong>Is there anything you can’t do during winter here?</strong>
Our honest answer is no. Sure, when the weather is bad, you’ll want to stay away from cliffy areas, and maybe be more cautious overall. However, because such weather doesn’t happen too often here, you can usually do anything you would otherwise do in the warmer months. We do mean anything – plenty of people have been known to sneak off to the beach, too!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1575" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/winter4.gif" alt="winter4.gif" width="322" height="144" />
Plus, because children have school and the parents take less time off, Malta will be less crowded than it usually is in summer. The ungodly morning traffic usually subsides by 9 am, and then exploring the island is a real breeze!

<strong>To summarise
</strong>
There’s no other way to say it: Maltese winters are great! Sure, it can get cold, and you might be subjected to some heavy rain every few weeks. That’s no different to most areas around the world, and if you’re disappointed about those prospects, you might be looking at the wrong continent to spend your winter months!

Malta is a great choice for a winter holiday, though, because it is a lot milder than a lot of other countries, and as a result you are still likely to enjoy some warmth here. The rain isn’t too frequent, and the cold is usually very bearable.
We encourage you to pack for all types of weather. Have some t-shirts handy alongside your jackets, pullovers, and scarves, and you’ll be completely set to enjoy your winter holiday here!

            [content] => It’s often said that Malta is a small island with an incredibly rich history. No matter how many times it’s repeated, it doesn’t get any less true. Our archipelago is a goldmine for any history nut, but we encourage anybody visiting the islands to get a good whiff of our past.
Sure, there are plenty of reasons to visit Malta and Gozo – but if you really want to get to know what we’re all about and why we are the way we are, a trip to some of our museums is definitely in order (we promise you’ll still have time to check out our beaches and shopping malls).
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1581 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/museum1.gif" alt="museum1.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Of course, a lot of history means a lot of museums, so the question becomes where to even begin. That’s where we come in! We’ve put together a list of a few of our favourite museums – and because we know that in no way does this cover them all, we guarantee that we’ll have similar blog posts with even more museums you’ll also want to visit in the future.

In the meantime, check out our current museum recommendations, listed below. If you’re feeling adventurous enough, you can even make a day tour of them! It wouldn’t even be a terribly taxing tour either, as the five museums we’ve mentioned today are only located in three different cities: Birgu, Valletta, and Imdina.

<strong>Malta Maritime Museum
</strong>You’d better get your sea legs moving for this one! As an island strategically positioned between Sicily and Africa, Malta has had an incredibly important maritime role in the Mediterranean spanning over 7000 years, all of which is documented in this Museum in Birgu.
The Malta Maritime Museum is located within the Old Naval Bakery, which couldn’t be more apt and adds to the charm of the place even more. Of course, it’s not the outside that’s most striking but the 20,000+ artefacts within. Among these are the largest ship model owned by the Order of St John, the oldest roman anchor in the world, a working steam engine from the 1950s, and much, much more!

<strong>Malta at War Museum</strong>
Also located in Birgu is the Malta at War Museum, which is a testament to the role Malta took up during WW2, particularly during the years 1940-1943 (which have collectively become known as the Malta Blitz).
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/museum2.gif" alt="museum2.gif" width="800" height="642" />
Located in an army barracks from the 18<sup>th</sup> century used during the war, the museum offers a mix of official artefacts and personal items from people fighting or affected by war somehow, making it a sobering but intriguing look at the largescale terror of WW2.
<strong>National War Museum</strong>
For the bloodthirsty (or, well, people who happen to be interested in wars), The National War Museum is another great option, but this time you’ll have to travel to Valletta, which is luckily the easiest thing to do in Malta ever.
Though the museum covers all eras of Malta’s war-stricken past, if you’re specifically interested in the World Wars you’ll find much pleasure in the two halls dedicated to just these times, which even hosts the George Cross bestowed to Malta (and interestingly enough, a jeep belonging to Roosevelt).
<strong>National Museum of Archaeology </strong>
If you’re still in Valletta and your craving for museums isn’t completely satisfied, the National Museum of Archaeology is the next place to check out (mind you, there are a lot of museums in Valletta worth visiting).
This museum covers archaeological artefacts from the Neolithic period (5000 BC) to Phoenician times (400 BC). It’s a wonderful insight to how some of our earliest island dwellers communicated through art and sculpture.

The museum hosts some of our most iconic items from megalithic times, including Hypogeum’s Sleeping Lady statue.

<strong>Wignacourt Museum</strong>
The Wignacourt Museum is located in Imdina and is named after one of the Grand Masters in Malta, Alof de Wignacourt. This isn’t surprising considering the building used to be the baroque residence of the chaplains of the Knights of St John.

The museum is not merely a historical exhibit of the Knights of St John though (although we wouldn’t complain if it were). Rather there’s a vast array of artefacts here, including a replica of the Hold Shroud of Turin, an altar used to celebrate mass during the time of the Knights, various coins and rare prints, and artworks by Antoine Favray, Mattia Preti, and several others.

            [content] => If you had to ask us, we’d tell you that Malta’s living costs are generally pretty reasonable. We won’t make the argument that Malta is the cheapest country to live in or even have a holiday in, but we do firmly believe that it’s very possible to budget yourself when coming here, resulting in a stay that is not only really exciting but relatively easy on the wallet.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1591" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cheap1.gif" alt="cheap1.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Now, we do understand that when you’re in a new country, particularly if it’s for leisure purposes, you might be inclined to spend and splurge. Believe us, we’ve been there! Still, you might wake up one day wanting to give your credit card a bit of rest while in Malta. If that’s ever the case, you can consult this article as a means of getting the most out of the islands while putting in as little cash as possible.
Besides, we really do believe that some of the best things in Malta will cost you next to nothing. Budgeting your days doesn’t necessarily mean compromising them. If nothing else, let this be an exercise in truly understanding that the greatest things in life really do transcend money.
<strong>Transport </strong>
As a visitor in Malta, you’ll either be renting a car or, much more likely, making use of public transport. Buses in Malta are quite well priced in comparison to what you’d find in several other countries. Of course, everywhere in Malta is pretty close, so there’s no way we could justify something like a €10 single journey train ticket. In fact, the standard bus rate here is €2 for a total use of two hours, meaning that you can use your bus ticket more than once.
That’s what we’d call a reasonable price, but of course if you travel constantly the bus fare might start looking a bit unfair. That’s why it’s worth the minor investment it takes to get a bus card suited to your needs. There are three cards mainly targeted to non-citizens, and these are the Explore Card for Adults, the Explore Card for Children, and the 12 Single Day Journeys Card.
The first two cost €21 and €15 respectively, and provide unlimited use for a whole week. The last card, which costs €15, is great if you’re not going to be using the bus too much and if you’re going to stay for longer than a week, but for the slight price difference we highly recommend going for the Explore Card option in most situations.
<strong>Food </strong>
It doesn’t take much to feast like a king in Malta. There are plenty of really fancy restaurants here you might want to check out at least once, but of course most people don’t have the cash to pay top dollar for food every single day. If you’re looking for great deals on lunch and dinner, prepare to feel like a winner with our suggestions.

If you’ve been in Malta even for the grand total of half an hour, it’s inevitable that the word <em>pastizzi</em> will have been mentioned in your presence. If you somehow do not already know what these are, they are possibly Malta’s most iconic food. They also happen to be dirt cheap (but taste much, much better than dirt). A savoury pastry usually either consisting of ricotta cheese or peas, the average one will run you around 40c. Don’t go crazy with these, despite the price, as they’re not exactly the healthiest thing around. They’re sure to make you lick your lips, though.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1593" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cheap2.gif" alt="cheap2.gif" width="283" height="229" />
If you’re also craving the most inexpensive desert you can find, nothing will beat a couple of <em>imqaret</em> from an outdoors stall. You can find these here and there, but the most famous is easily the Dates Kiosk in Valletta. The name is more than apt, as <em>imqaret</em> are fried pastries with a filling made from dates. Just like the <em>pastizzi</em> mentioned above, you can get full on <em>imqaret</em> with spare change.
Another alternative for Maltese cuisine is heading to a baker’s shop to buy a piping hot <em><u>ftira</u></em>, which is an iconic kind of bread made here. This might be a slightly pricier option, but only if you choose to buy other items to make a sandwich. Fresh <em>ftajjar</em> (the plura of <em>ftira</em>) smell so good you might end up eating them as soon as you buy them! Why not get one in the morning for an extremely filling breakfast?
Of course, you will want to wash that delicious food down with a drink. No trip to Malta is complete without tasting a couple of our local beers, which easily hold their own against plenty of foreign beers. We dare you to try a Cisk beer and disagree – it’s just not possible. The really good news? The average price for a local beer is €1.50. If you find the right supermarket, you might even get the whole pint for that price.

<strong>The sights</strong>

This is the crux of it all, isn’t it? You really don’t need us to tell you that Malta is gorgeous. The best part about this fact is that experiencing Malta’s beauty is free, once you’re here.
Put down those postcards depicting Maltese sights, and go experience those sights first hand. You can’t call Malta breath-taking if you don’t let it take your breath away.
Take a hike. That’s not an insult – Malta has plenty of wonderful and green walking hiking areas (and we’ll definitely make it a point to talk more about them in the future). Dingli, Chadwick Lakes, and Bidnija are just a few areas where you can stretch your legs and soak in the greenery. Plus, they also make great spots where you can relax and have a picnic.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1594" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cheap3.gif" alt="cheap3.gif" width="320" height="212" />
Though it’s getting somewhat colder, spending time at a beach is always an option here, provided that the weather isn’t rough. You don’t even need to swim either – relaxing on the shore and breathing in that fresh saltwater air while looking at the crystal clear seas and rocky surroundings is more than enough. Ramla l-Ħamra, Riviera, Fekruna, and Golden Bay are just a few places that will make anyone feel at one with nature.

            [content] => It’s official: Christmas is less than a month away. That means that we can we can talk about our favourite holiday without shame; when we want and for how long we want to. Scrooges of Malta, beware!

Joking aside, it’s impossible to not get excited about Christmas and its traditions. Regardless of what the holiday represents to you, we’re sure most of you associate fond memories of love and cheer with this time of the year.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1599" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta1.gif" alt="imbuljuta1.gif" width="610" height="366" />
Malta, of course, celebrates Christmas in its own unique way, and the seasonal Imbuljuta tal-Qastan forms part of these celebrations. Of course, many of you reading this article are probably scratching their heads right now, wondering what it actually is.
Simply put, it is a magical-tasting concoction made out of chestnuts and cocoa, alongside some other ingredients. The combination is heavenly, which is apt considering that it is usually served after Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta2.gif" alt="imbuljuta2.gif" width="900" height="506" />

If you can’t wait till Mass, though, or if you weren’t planning on going at all, here’s a recipe for you to make Imbuljuta tal-Qastan by yourself! No one will blame you for getting a head start – people like the drink so much that they also extend the tradition to New Year’s Eve, after all.
Making Imbuljuta tal-Qastan is, luckily, really easy to make. If you have kids, you could let them help and join in on the fun!
<strong>Recipe</strong>

<ul >
	<li>400g dried chestnuts</li>
	<li>80g dark chocolate</li>
	<li>80g cocoa powder</li>
	<li>Orange rind</li>
	<li>2 tangerine rinds</li>
	<li>4tblsp brown sugar</li>
	<li>2 tblsp ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>1 ½ tblsp mixed spice</li>
</ul>

The most essential part is probably the first step, which is preparing the chestnuts accordingly by soaking them in cold water for two hours. Once this is done, place them in a saucepan with cold water and boil them until they get a little soft.
Don’t boil them for an excessively long time, as they will keep getting tender as the recipe progresses and the last thing you want is for them to get too mushy too soon.
The rest of it is easy – add the rest of the ingredients, stir and make sure everything dissolves and blends into one thick drink. Once it’s ready, pour it into your favourite mug and drink away!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1603" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta3.gif" alt="imbuljuta3.gif" width="250" height="347" />
There’s a lot of flexibility here. Some people can’t live without the dark chocolate, but others prefer to simply use the cocoa powder. You could also experiment with milk chocolate instead. Similarly, the orange and tangerine rinds can be grated or cut into strips, depending on your preference.

Keep in mind to adjust the ratios here depending on how much you plan on making. This recipe should serve a lot of people – 10 is probably too few. So if you’re catering for smaller numbers, calculate what needs to be altered.
That means that how long it takes for the Imbuljuta to be ready also varies. On average, it takes around half an hour for everything to blend together, but you may need more or less time. What’s most essential is that you manage to balance the fine line of being thick but still very drinkable – so keep checking it till you’re happy.
What if you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, and want to make your Imbuljuta tal-Qastan recipe a bit more contemporary? We have a couple of recommendations you could try, including:
<strong>Spice</strong>
The recipe we’ve provided already calls for the addition of some mixed spice, but you can really spice your drink up to give it a fiery twist. The combination of chilli and chocolate is a marvellous one, and we guarantee that bringing that element to your Imbuljuta will change the game completely. After all, you need to bring the heat to battle those cold nights!<strong>

Alcohol</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1606" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta4.gif" alt="imbuljuta4.gif" width="500" height="222" />
This one is for adults only, of course! Chocolate pairs with alcohol excellently, and there’s really no limit to what you can add to the recipe to give it a nice, boozy kick. For something a little less conventional, we suggest a nice coffee liquor, but some whiskey or rum would also work wonders. We would recommend saving the boozy batch for an occasion other than Midnight Mass, though. <strong>

            [content] => If you’re dreaming of a white Christmas, you might initially be disappointed by what Malta has to offer this holiday season. Snow alone doesn’t make a good Christmas, though! In fact, we can say with confidence that Malta’s Christmas is one of the most exciting around. We even have the CNN backing our claims up, as in 2015 the world famous news company rated us one of the 15 most Christmassy places in the world.
In other words, we might be low in snow, but we’re high in Christmas spirit!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1611" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrismassy1.gif" alt="chrismassy1.gif" width="400" height="300" />
Which means that in the spirit of giving, we can’t help but let you in on some of the best places to get your Christmas fix this year. Our list isn’t exhaustive though, because the holiday really is everywhere, from pretty much every Maltese household to the decorated streets outside. Cribs, for example, are basically set up in every nook and cranny.
If you’re a Grinch, you really won’t be able to escape the season in Malta. We bet you’re not, though, so without further ado, here are some places to get your Christmas spirit roaring:
<strong>Għajnsielem</strong>
Għajnsielem is a little rural town in Gozo, which makes it the perfect place to host the annual Bethlehem f’Għajnsielem, which is a life-sized, animated nativity experience. We’re not joking when we say life-sized, either, as the whole event takes place over 20,000sqm of land. Visitors are given a map to find their way around the makeshift Betlehem, and is a look into the birth of Jesus Christ as much as it is a look into the lifestyle of the time.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1613" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrismassy2.gif" alt="chrismassy2.gif" width="480" height="266" />
This year’s edition is running between the 11<sup>th</sup> of December to the 8<sup>th</sup> of January.
<strong>Valletta</strong>

You knew this answer was coming, but of course we had to mention it anyway! Our capital city becomes nothing short of a Christmas Village during the holiday season, with decorations covering every imaginable space. You can even check out an impressive, 35-foot-tall Christmas tree at the Valletta Waterfront.

On that note, the Waterfront is a great place to take your kids during this time of the year as during weekends and public holidays you’ll find a wide array of free children’s entertainment to make their day more joyous.
Of course, there are plenty of activities worth checking out in Valletta – far too many to list in one article. Perhaps the epitome of Christmas spirit is captured no better than in the annual International Christmas Carol Concert, that takes place in St. John’s Co-Cathedral. It’s a stunning display of song and music, and is actually a fund-raiser, so it’s well worth the €15 ticket. Make sure to book this one, as no tickets will be sold at the door!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1615" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrismassy3.gif" alt="chrismassy3.gif" width="400" height="275" />
<strong>Mosta</strong>
It might be an unconventional choice, but Mosta seems to be determined to be put on the Christmas map this year with the Jollywood Winter Fair taking place on the 10<sup>th</sup> of December at the QSI International School. The event is free entrance, runs from 12pm to 5pm, and will feature countless stalls with food and trinkets to buy, as well as an ample amount of entertainment options (including pony rides!)
<strong>Imdina

</strong>Imdina is cosy and quaint, so it’s easy to see why the place lends itself to Christmas warmth and cheer. Luckily, you’ll find quite a few activities that makes it even more of Christmassy spot. You’ll find carolling everywhere, and that includes a concert entitled <em>A Prelude to Christmas</em>, happening on the 17<sup>th</sup> of December at St. Paul’s Cathedral. The event is in aid of Dar il-Providenza, and features the Amadeus Christmas Choir. Also guesting will be a selection of the Marsa Scouts Pipes and Drums.
<strong>Popeye Village, Mellieħa</strong>
If you don’t yet know what Popeye Village is, it’s a unique theme park that started life as the film set for the musical production ‘Popeye’ in 1980. Every Christmas, it changes its tune by setting up a wonderful Santa’s Toytown, which is a great way for the kids to see elves making gifts and play games. This year, Santa’s Toytown is open from the 6<sup>th</sup> of December to the 4<sup>th</sup> of January.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1617" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrismassy4.gif" alt="chrismassy4.gif" width="480" height="366" />
In addition to simply visiting Santa’s Toytown, this year you can book a special Christmas package that comes with a ton of other goodies, including a gift for every child, access to a family treasure hunt, animation shows, and even the chance to visit Santa himself at a new house attraction.

            [content] => Not many Maltese people would readily admit that we have too many public holidays, and let’s face it; why would we? Public holidays are great! Our island is home to the most holidays in the European Union, which we’re happy to count as a pretty substantial achievement.
Besides, public holidays aren’t just fun, whimsical days where we get to laze about instead of going to work. On the contrary, most of them represent really meaningful national events. Perhaps this is no better exemplified than on the 13<sup>th</sup> of December, when the Maltese celebrate the day the island officially became a republic.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1623 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/republic1.gif" alt="republic1.gif" width="500" height="281" />
If you’re here on holiday on Republic day, the whole off-day thing will probably be a bit lost on you, since you definitely wouldn’t be working anyway. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t get into the spirit of the holiday. In fact, it gives you even more reason to appreciate the history and implications of the day, since you have no motive to celebrate other than connecting with the rich story of the Maltese islands. That’s why we’re providing some historical content about Republic day for you so that on the 13<sup>th</sup> of December you can jump for joy with the rest of us!

<strong>The history in a nutshell</strong>
You might already know that the majority of Malta’s history involves being ruled by some foreign power, which means that the fact that we were colonised by the British Empire should be even less surprising. The British took over in 1800 after kicking out the French, who occupied the islands for only a couple of years. Although the British initially ruled de facto, meaning that they were not official rulers, they were later elected by the Maltese themselves in 1813 to become the island’s de jure leaders.
It turned out that Malta became a pretty important asset to the British. We became a shipping stop thanks to our strategic position in the Mediterranean, especially when the Suez Canal opened. Our geographic advantage also proved extremely useful in both world wars, as the islands served as fantastic hospital stations while also providing handy routes to access Italian territory.
After World War II, Malta still remained under the British, although discourse soon opened with regard to what course of action should be taken as far as Malta’s status was concerned. There was even an attempt to integrate with Great Britain, although this ultimately was not successful. Finally, in 1964, Malta managed to achieve its independence, and eventually became a republic just ten years later. Sir Anthony Mamo was declared our first President.
Every year, in the spirit of Republic Day, the President of Malta holds an awards ceremony, celebrating individuals who have brought honour to Malta in their own way.
<strong>Independent? Republic? What’s the difference?</strong>
It’s a fair question, especially considering that we celebrate both pretty equally here. The main difference is that when Malta achieved independence, it became part of the Commonwealth, and as such the British monarch remained the ultimate head of state. When Malta became a republic, it was a final change in status, and we officially stopped thinking of Queen Elizabeth as our own queen.
Despite this, British troops remained in Malta until 31<sup>st</sup> March 1979 (Freedom Day), but that’s another public holiday altogether!
<strong>What’s the buzz?</strong>
Naturally, if you want to get into the spirit of Republic day, you’ll be looking for ways to celebrate. There are plenty of activities set up every year, including military parades around Valletta and Marsa, and wreath laying ceremonies at notable, Republic Day-related monuments. You can even catch the annual band concert, which takes place at the Manoel Theatre in Valletta, where you can hear some traditional marching band music.

One thing you definitely won’t want to escape are the vibrant fireworks. Though you can find these all over Malta, your best bet is to view them over the Grand Harbour in Valletta.

            [content] => It doesn’t matter if you’re Maltese, English, Australian, American, Chinese, or from anywhere else in the world. The language of sweets and desserts is one that we all understand! There’s something special about travelling to a new country and finding out (and tasting first hand, of course) which sweets are made there. The same is true (perhaps even truer) when those treats are brought out during Christmas time!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1633" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas2.gif" alt="christmas2.gif" width="282" height="211" />
As we all know, Christmas is just another excuse to indulge in some sugary goods. There are plenty of different treats that we associate with Malta during this time of year, although not all of them are exclusively Christmassy – which is great news in itself because it means you won’t have to wait for months on end to get your hands on some of our most coveted goods.
If you happen to be in Malta during the Christmas season, here are some treats to look out for!
<strong>Qagħaq tal-Għasel</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1636 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas3.jpg" alt="christmas3.jpg" width="428" height="297" />

Known in English as treacle rings, this dessert is so scrumptious that you might consider proposing to your wife by putting one of these rings on her finger instead the usual gold or diamond option.

These special qagħaq are a great choice for those who don’t like their desserts to be saturated with sweetness. Though there is certainly an underlying sweet taste, it’s wonderfully balanced out by the slight bitterness of the treacle and the zesty flavour of the citrus infused into the baking mix.
<strong>Almond Macaroons</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1638 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas4.jpg" alt="christmas4" width="620" height="413" />
If you knew anything about Maltese desserts prior to this article, you’d probably know that it’s very hard for us to keep<em> lewż</em> (almonds) out of our sweet treats. This is especially the case in Easter, where our treats tend to be made up of 95% almonds and almond paste (see: <em>figolli</em> and <em>kwareżimal</em>).
Thanks to our <em>Lewż</em> <em>before Bros</em> mentality, you can still get your almond fix this Christmas thanks to the macaroons that pop up everywhere. Not necessarily an exclusively Maltese treat by any stretch of the imagination – but don’t tell us you’re not grateful that we love them so much.
<strong>Pudina tal-Ħobż</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1640 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas5.jpg" alt="christmas5" width="600" height="399" />

This is our famous bread pudding, a classic choice for everyone from <em>nanniet</em> (grandmothers) to children. If you’re not a fan of raisins and candied fruit, this might take some getting used to, but we’re pretty sure that come to appreciate the taste sooner rather than later!
This is definitely one of the treats that is appreciated all year round – but Christmas is as good a time as any to make a fresh batch! Do note that it’s not the typical Christmas pudding that’s eaten around the world (including Malta!), and not a replacement either!
<strong>Imbuljuta tal-Qastan</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1644 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas6.jpg" alt="christmas6.jpg" width="625" height="384" />

We already spoke quite a bit about this one in a previous blog post, and even included a recipe for it, so head on there if you’re interested in making it! This is a soup/drink hybrid made out of chestnuts, cocoa and chocolate, a well an assortment of other ingredients that contribute to its unique taste.
<strong>Christmas Log</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1647" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas7.gif" alt="christmas7.gif" width="500" height="332" />
It’s not quite Christmas without a Christmas log, and that’s regardless of where you are in the world. So no, this isn’t quite a Maltese treat, but of course we have the Maltese way of preparing it, which isn’t too outlandish. We keep the same chocolatey/biscuit taste, but often tend to add the candied fruit we seem to collectively love so much!

            [content] => Christmas is just around the corner, and you’ve probably guessed by our recent flow of articles that we couldn’t be more excited about it!
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1653 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib1.gif" alt="crib1" width="200" height="286" />
It’s probably very easy to understand our enthusiasm (and if it’s not, we kindly ask you to bear with us for a few more weeks). If you’re in Malta and need to get into the Christmas spirit (or need an excuse to get into it even further) we’ve come up with a little checklist for things to look out for during the Christmas season in Malta. It mostly covers things you’ll find when you’re out and about, as well as things that you can actively look out for!
<strong>Nativity scenes</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1655" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib2.gif" alt="crib2.gif" width="480" height="368" />
Whether you’re religious or not, it really is a wonder how the Maltese seemingly manage to set up nativity scenes in every single available space. These are known as <em>presepji</em> in Maltese (<em>presepju</em> for the singular term), so you’d better get used to the word!
For quite a few of us, decorating <em>presepji</em> is a hobby to be taken religiously (please excuse the pun). Which means that if you look around, you’ll find many intricately detailed ones that will leave you pretty stunned.
You’ll also find that there are plenty of larger <em>presepji</em> set up for public display everywhere, from roundabouts to used car showrooms. You could start a <em>presepju</em> spotting tally with a friend!

<strong>Cribs</strong>
Don’t confuse <em>presepji</em> with cribs (<em>maxturi</em>) in Malta! These are usually more relegated to domestic displays, but you’ll find plenty of them in public spots too. Though you have less going on here than in the full-blown nativity scene, there are lots of differently styled cribs to gaze at, as you’ll find out by looking at 99% of current Maltese shop windows.
<strong>Vetches</strong>
This is a Christmas tradition that we reckon is more Maltese than most. Vetches is known in Maltese as <em>ġulbiena</em>, and refers to a long, thin plant that is grown to decorate cribs and <em>presepji</em>. Traditionally planted on the 7<sup>th</sup> of December, this plant needs to grow in the dark. In just a few weeks, your <em>ġulbiena</em> could be the envy of all!
<strong>Decorations and lighting</strong>
If you’ve ever been to Malta during a village <em>festa</em>, then you know that it doesn’t take much for us to cover entire cities with decorations. It’s a mentality we happily uphold during Christmas. Though we’ve already brushed up on a few of the most Christmassy locations in Malta, it’s very hard to say that there’s any one city that is not Christmassy at all!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1657" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib3.gif" alt="crib3.gif" width="320" height="180" />
Some of the street decorations tend to get pretty unique, too. An example of this is a florescent light decoration that goes up every year in Birkirkara. It spells ‘SMART’, in reference to the Smart Supermarket in that street. The not-so-subtle marketing initiative never fails to crack us up.
Churches around Malta also brighten up during the Christmas season (as you’d expect), and seeing the beautiful light display is always a jolly sight every time.
<strong>Charity collections</strong>
Well, we might take Christmas seriously, but no one can accuse us of being all flash, no substance. We still give importance to charity during the rest of the year, of course, but just like in many other countries, the spirit of Christmas unscrooges us further, and opportunities to give to the needy spring up everywhere.
What’s more is that people will also come up with new ways to raise charity funds. Just recently, for example, a Ronnie James Dio tribute concert was given in aid of cancer patients in Malta.
One of Malta’s most important and well-known charity events that takes place annually is called <em>L-Istrina </em>and is known for raising millions of euros in aid of sufferers of all chronic diseases. This year, the televised event will take place on boxing day, and is sure to raise similar figures to those seen in previous years.
<strong>Christmas markets</strong>
Amidst all the charity, of course, you can still have some money in your pocket to visit a few Christmas markets and stock up on a few trinkets. From decorations to artisan crafts and little gifts, these markets are a great way to remember that one doesn’t need to spend ridiculous amounts of money to indulge a little during Christmas.

Though some Christmas markets have already taken place, you can still visit the Pjazza Tigne Christmas Market in Sliema (7<sup>th</sup>-28<sup>th</sup> December).

<strong>Pantomimes</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1659" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib4.gif" alt="crib4.gif" width="314" height="360" />
Malta has a very strong Christmas pantomime culture, and as such every year two main productions are set up by two different theatre companies, the MADC, and Masquerade. These groups are often seen as rivals, but the reality is that you can of course choose to see both pantos if you so wish.
MADC’s pantomime for this year is called <em>Un-Believe It!</em>, and is taking place at the MFCC in Ta’ Qali. It’s got themes of magic and what seem to be quite a few Harry Potter references, so potterheads will love this production for sure.
Masquerade’s panto, taking place at the Manoel Theatre in Valletta is called <em>Puss in Boots</em>. No prizes for guessing the inspiration behind the story! In fact, <em>Puss in Boots</em> promises to be a continuation of Masquerade’s panto tradition of creating cheeky renditions of fairy tales.
Both pantos are running from the 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> of December (respectively) up until the 8<sup>th</sup> of January. They’re a treat for the whole family and we promise you’ll be in stitches – but we do warn you that you might want to acquaint yourself with local political gossip to understand all the references!

            [content] => Music fans in Malta are truly blessed. From alternative rock to EDM, one doesn’t need to venture far to find a thriving scene. Yet not everyone might know that Malta is also home to one of Europe’s most exciting Baroque music festivals. If you’re the kind of person who would rather baroque on than rock on, look no further than our lovely capital city in January 2017.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1677 size-medium" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/baroque1.gif?w=300" alt="Piano playing" width="300" height="225" />
The Valletta International Baroque Music Festival has not been around nearly as long as the music it celebrates, having only debuted in 2013. Despite this, it has quickly risen to fame as one of the festivals to look out for, year after year.
Perhaps it’s not surprising that Valletta is such an appropriate setting for the event, considering that ultimately it was built in the Baroque era by the Knights of St. John. The festival takes place across multiple venues in our capital city, which is great for a couple of reasons. The first is that you get to see and experience more of Valletta, and the second is that every venue is absolutely fitting in setting the mood for each concert.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1678 size-medium" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/baroque2.gif?w=300" alt="baroque2" width="300" height="300" />
There are far too many of these venues to mention, but the heart of it all is the Manoel Theatre, one of the oldest theatres in Europe which has remained active to this day. As Malta’s National Theatre, there is no doubt that the Manoel Theatre is the perfect place to host the festival. There are several concerts hosted at other wonderful venues too, though, which include St. John’s Co-Cathedral, the Grandmasters’ Palace, and several churches and auberges.
In line with the quality we’ve come to expect from the Valletta International Baroque Music Festival, the programme features a dynamic range of local and international guests, which come in the form of both solo performers and whole orchestras.
We can’t say there’s any one guest we’re most excited about, as the whole programme is promising. However, a few of our anticipated highlights include:

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reiko Ichise</strong>, a Tokyo-born viola da gamba player who has become known as one of the leading musicians in the UK with regard to her instrument of choice</li>
 	<li><strong>The Sixteen</strong>, which is unquestionably one of the world’s greatest ensembles, with an artist residency at Wigmore Hall being only one of the prestigious recognitions awarded to it in the UK</li>
 	<li><strong>Haymarket Opera Company</strong>, which is definitely one of the leading orchestras to keep an eye out for when it comes to 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century material</li>
 	<li><strong>Nicolas Dautricourt</strong>, who is one of France’s finest violinists in the way of chamber music</li>
</ul>
As you might imagine, this does not even begin to cover the complete programme of artists, but luckily you can check that out on the festival’s website, with inclusions of the dates and venues they’ll be performing at. Conduct proper research so that you can choose your favourites! Check out the full program here: <a href="http://vallettabaroquefestival.com.mt/index.php?option=com_contentamp;view=articleamp;id=73amp;Itemid=83">http://vallettabaroquefestival.com.mt/index.php?option=com_contentamp;view=articleamp;id=73amp;Itemid=83</a>

Unlike many festivals (although you do need to keep in mind that this is not exactly your Primavera or Coachella), you will need to pay every individual performance. Considering that these artists of extremely high calibre, this is not unreasonable. We also reckon that you won’t be able to catch more than a few performances anyway, so this arrangement may suit you far better than having a single block ticket. Students and senior citizens should be aware that special discounted tickets are available.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1680 size-full" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/baroque4.gif" alt="baroque4" width="250" height="192" />
All in all, the Valletta International Baroque Music Festival is absolutely worth your time, and is the place to be if you happen to be in Malta in the mid-to-end period of January. Though you could expect a great festival any year, this year it happens to coincide with the EU Presidency of 2017, which is bound to mean that no details have gone unnoticed in the mission to further Malta’s status as a beacon of culture.

            [content] => If you’ve been in Malta for more than a week then you’ll have realised by now that it doesn’t take the Maltese much to get celebrating – which means that you can bet that we’re pros when it comes to celebrating something as colossal as New Year’s Eve!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1691 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye2.gif" alt="nye2" width="720" height="480" />

In fact, there are options to suit everybody, no matter their preference. Whether you’re into partying, concerts, or anything else, it’s not too late to find your ideal NYE location. If this is your first time celebrating the foray into a new year in Malta, we definitely recommend going to the national NYE celebrations in our capital city, Valletta!

Taking place between 8.30 pm to 2 am, there’s plenty happening before and after the special midnight mark. That’s exactly what you’d expect from an event collaborated on by two organisations that are outstanding in their own ways: G7 Events and the Valletta 2018 – European Capital of Culture Foundation. These two groups have also teamed up with the Ministry for Tourism, the Valletta Local Council, and even the Ministry of Culture.

Sticking to the traditions set in previous years, the event is taking place in St George’s Square and will also free of charge, meaning that your wallet won’t take a beating from the high spending expectations that often come with the night!

Saving on costs shouldn’t (and thankfully definitely isn’t) the only reason why you should attend. Here is a list of the happenings you can look forward to on the night, although don’t be surprised if even more features are announced in the coming days!

<strong>Music</strong>
<strong> </strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1693" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye3.gif" alt="nye3.gif" width="480" height="256" />

NYE wouldn’t be NYE without good music you can dance to – and if the music is live then it gets even better! The night will feature a roster of some of Malta’s most celebrated artists, including Kevin Borg, Glen Vella, The Crowns, Musique and more.

There will also be DJs, namely Clint Bajada and Pierre Cordina, who will give you the chance to let loose even further.

For a more sophisticated but no less excited segment, you can immerse yourself in the vibes of a symphony of musicians selected from the Orchestra Philharmonic Malta, conducted by Sigmund Mifsud.

<strong>Projections and Fireworks

</strong>The inclusion of fireworks and firecrackers really goes without saying. The Maltese are the kind of people you can expect to set off fireworks in celebration of afternoon tea, so the NYE fireworks display is guaranteed to be huge and stunning.

There will be other visual shows to keep an eye out for, though, including a 3D venture projection made by the MCAST Institute for the Creative Arts that will actually be running from the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December up until the new year. This show will be projected on the façade of the Grandmaster’s Palace.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1694" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye4.gif" alt="nye4.gif" width="500" height="272" />

The star of the show here is definitely going to be G7’s audiovisual countdown, complete with pyrotechnics!

<strong>Comedy</strong>
<strong> </strong>
<strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1696" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye5.gif" alt="nye5.gif" width="598" height="673" />

</strong>
Two of Malta’s most popular comedians, Pawlu Borg Bonaci and Gianni Zammit will come together as a duo to help you enter 2017 in stitches! There’s no way we can guess what to expect from the dynamic pair, except that it’s bound to be cheeky! Both people are known for their musical prowess too, so we’re definitely hopeful for a side-splitting musical number.
<strong>

</strong>
All in all, the Valletta NYE celebrations are not the only option this year – far from it – but if you want to do NYE Maltese style on a national level, this is the way to do it. With a combination of all the things we love the most about NYE, including music, fireworks, and comedy, Valletta is going to provide the whole package this year.

Plus, we guarantee that you’re going to meet a massive amount of people!

            [content] => As we wave our final goodbyes to 2016, we’re thankful for all the technological advances made this year – but we’re still terribly miffed that science hasn’t granted us the ability to physically be in multiple places at once.

You see, this is a problem because it means we can only choose one party to go to for New Year’s Eve 2016!

Last week, we wrote about the grand NYE celebrations in Valletta, which is still a fantastic option. For anyone looking for alternative hangouts for the night, though, here’s a list of candidates that could capture your attention. We can’t say we’ve covered every single option (a list that long is one you probably wouldn’t finish reading until 2017), but we have tried to cover a range of options to suit the tastes of as many people as we could!<strong>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/740922012722172/" target="_blank">ALT NYE 2016</a>
</strong><strong>
</strong>You can’t talk about NYE alternatives without mentioning 2016’s biggest alternative scene party! Taking place at The Warehouse Club in Zurrieq, the party is the result of four respected event organisers coming together: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TrackageScheme/">Trackage Scheme</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SickofAnts/">Sick of Ants</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nosweatproductions/">No Sweat Productions</a> amp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hedonevents/">Hedon Crew</a>.
The entertainment will be provided by an eclectic mix of live bands and DJs. The list of bands includes Kill the Action, Beesqueeze, Lucy’s Last, and Bila. If you’re unaware of these bands, they all fall into some category of alternative rock and punk, so you know it’s going to be a pretty loud and raunchy experience!

The DJs are set up over two areas, and include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LVXLVXLVX/">LVX</a>, Geddumu, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/benvincenti">Ben Vincenti</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/danjelimusic/">Danjeli</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acidulant303/">Acidulant</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sean.rickett.7">Seán Rickett</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heykerg/">Kerg</a>.

<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/963278737110021/" target="_blank">MokSHA New Year’s Eve – NYE by Duncan F</a>
</strong><strong>
</strong>If you’re more invested in the dancefloor than live music, MokSHA is probably for you. Hosted by one of Malta’s top DJs, Duncan F, this event features him alongside a vast array of his peers. Alex Thomson, Twain, Julian Drury, and Tiffany are just a few of the DJs who will be spinning pounding electronic tunes all night.

<strong>NYE at Hugo’s Terrace

            [content] => Though the coming of 2017 marks the dawn of a new year, it also marks the realisation that the for the next few months, we can expect the peak of Malta’s cold weather. Of course, it’s hard to really complain about the cold in Malta, since we don’t reach sub-zero temperatures as other countries do.

It does indeed get chilly – but rather than complain, we should celebrate the weather by enjoying a delicious cup of coffee and tasty treat from one of Malta’s cosiest cafés!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1728" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe1.gif" alt="Cafe1.gif" width="540" height="641" />

For anyone who is a fan of warm drinks and the like, Malta is quite the paradise. Many cafés here understand the art of making a satisfying cup of love – and what could be better than enjoying a cup of love, paired with a toasty snack, in a cosy setting?

Of course, the list of places we’ve included here is by no means intended to denounce the myriad other cafés that can tickle your taste buds just as well!
<strong>Café Jubilee</strong>
Located in both Valletta, Gzira, and Victoria (Gozo), Café Jubilee has become quite the franchise since its beginnings in 1998. Known for its chique décor, there’s a very swing-era feel to this café which is hard not to be enchanted by. Café Jubilee often hosts live acoustic music too, which never fails to add to the ambiance!
We’re also huge fans of the food – there’s everything from delicious sandwiches, pasta, and an array of other options.
<strong>Molly’s Café
</strong>A much more recent venue, Molly’s Café quickly made waves for one particular reason – its pancakes!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe2.gif" alt="Cafe2.gif" width="506" height="358" />
Though Molly’s serves an array of tantalising desserts (and great coffee too, of course), its pancakes soon became the stuff of legend. With staples like Red Velvet pancakes, and seasonal ones like Mince Pie pancakes, it’s not hard to see why! Don’t forget to stop here during your next visit to Mosta!

<strong>Il-Kikkra Café

</strong>Il-Kikkra is an old favourite Valletta stop, and definitely is one of the cafés on this list that does cosiness best. In fact, sitting at Il-Kikkra can be a bit of a tight squeeze, but if you can find a place when it’s not too crowded, the visit will be quite the treat.

Speaking of treats, Il-Kikkra is known for its delicious snacks. Essentially, they’re baked versions of the food you’d find at pastizzi vendors, so you get double the deliciousness and half the guilt. Our favourite offering is the meat pie, by far!
<strong>Café Cordina
</strong>
Café Cordina certainly doesn’t need our endorsement, but we’re recommending them anyway because its service definitely lives up to its fantastic reputation.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe3.gif" alt="Cafe3.gif" width="400" height="300" />

This is another Valletta café, but is undoubtedly one of the most popular around the island! Aside from the obviously great food and coffee, patrons can enjoy live jazz every Thursday at the Piazza Regina.
<strong>Fontanella

</strong>Fontanella is the most well-known café in Imdina, and it’s so easy to see why. There are so many reasons why a trip to Fontanella is a must for anybody in Malta. For starters, you will have an impeccable view of the Maltese islands, if you sit upstairs. It’s a gorgeous sight.

The food menu is also very good, with a great range of sandwiches and pizzas to choose from. However, the crowning jewel of the Fontanella menu is definitely its famous chocolate cake, which is possibly half the reason for the café’s great reputation.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe4.gif" alt="Cafe4.gif" width="400" height="300" />

<strong>Talbot amp; Bons

</strong>Talbot amp; Bons is located at the Malta International Airport, making it a worthy consideration as a place to refuel right before or after boarding a flight! That being said, this is definitely a café that commands your attention. It’s stylish and modern, and is full of spectacular boutique products you won’t find anywhere else in Malta, including beer, chocolates, and juices.

            [content] => Malta means many different things to many different people, but it seems to be a collective understanding that above all it is a beautiful place of great historical and cultural value. With all the preparations for 2018, in which Valletta will be the cultural capital of Europe, it’s hard to forget this. Let’s take a step back, though. It’s not 2018 just yet – it’s the very beginning of 2017, so let’s have a look at a few of those pockets of wonder and beauty that have been around for years and years!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums2.gif" alt="museums2.gif" width="499" height="281" />
Those pockets of wonder are often best captured through the myriad Maltese museums that you can visit around the islands. We’ve already done a segment on Maltese museums, highlighting some of the top locations to get your history fix. However, the talent for curation we have here spreads much wider, so here are a few more Malta Museums for your delectation!
<strong>National Museum of Fine Arts
</strong>
Museums aren’t just about history, and yet everything within them is inherently historical (but that’s a discussion best kept for University or Saturdays at 4 a.m.). Perhaps that’s why we have such a deep-rooted love for the National Museum of Fine Arts – it’s such a stunning display of some of finest artworks in Malta, yet those artworks are inevitably a celebration of the historical period they were created in.
In fact, most of the artworks in this Valletta museum were created during the time of the Order of St John. Here you can find works by Valentin de Boulone, Jusepe Ribera, Guido Reni, Albert Bierstadt, Joseph Mallord Wlliam Turner, and others. The centrepiece of the museum perhaps comes in the form of Mattia Preti’s works, and indeed you won’t find a larger collection of his paintings anywhere else in the world.
The building in which the museum is located is also a testament to history in itself, being one of the oldest buildings erected during the time of the Knights and serving multiple purposes during its existence, from a residence to the Order to becoming the Admiralty House for the British during the 1820s.
<em>Please note: The National Museum of Fine Arts closed its doors on the 2nd October 2016, and will be reopening in 2018 as MUZA, the new national community art museum at the Auberge d'Italie in Valletta.

<strong>The Inquisitor’s Palace</strong>
Another historical-building-turned-museum, the Inquisitor’s Palace is a must visit because there are virtually no such palaces left around the world. Many of these got wiped out during the French Revolution. The Maltese Inquisitor’s Palace in Birgu, thankfully, is still intact.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1746 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums3.gif" alt="museums3" width="400" height="300" />
Sure, the implications of inquisition might be morbid, but they are fascinating nonetheless, and considering that it has been the residence of all inquisitors from 1574 till the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century, much work was done to turn the palace into a gorgeous mansion.
<strong>Domvs Romana</strong>
Though not one of the larger museums in Malta, the Domvs Romana in Rabat certainly provides the most fascinating and rewarding insight into our ties with Roman culture and art.

The Domvs Romana is most highly associated with its mosaic displays, and although these are stunning it also houses various other artefacts. More than just a display of Roman art, the museum provides insight into the lifestyles and roles inhabited by Roman families in Malta.

The museum itself has quite a bit of history, as it too is the aftermath of an ancient aristocratic Roman townhouse found in 1881. Just a year later, the townhouse became a public museum. The museum has been renovated a number of times to preserve its structure and the art within.
<strong>Malta Aviation Museum</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1748 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums4.gif" alt="museums4" width="400" height="275" />

The Malta Aviation Museum is located in Ta Qali, which is the former airfield of the Royal Air Force in Malta, once again making it the most apt place to host its exhibits. The museum is spread over three separate hangars, each of them containing a number of impressive planes used throughout Malta’s aviation history, but of course mostly covering those used in Second World War and Post-war periods.
<strong>Gozo Museum of Archaeology</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums5.gif" alt="museums5.gif" width="480" height="275" />
In our last article, we spoke about the National Museum of Archeology in Malta, but to witness the archaeological wonders of Gozo, you’ll have to visit the museum that is set behind the original gateway to the Citadel. Once a 17<sup>th</sup> century townhouse, the Gozo Museum of Archeology now hosts examples of archaeology in three main divisions: prehistory, the classical period, and Medieval/Early Modern periods.

            [content] => One thing that is very well known about Malta is the high regard we hold for the Eurovision, but that doesn’t quite do justice to the quality of music you’ll find here if you dig a little deeper.
Now, we’re not necessarily trying to demonise that festival, but we will say that it’s almost embarrassing how few people in comparison know how great and vibrant Malta’s live music scene is, especially once you start looking into local alternative acts who are bold and experimental in their approach while still being tasteful and catchy.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1756 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bands2.gif" alt="bands2" width="500" height="234" />
It’s really easy to get excited for local music, especially in 2017, when so many stellar acts have promised that an album or other kind of release is in the pipeline. The only pity is that not enough people know about them!
That’s why for this article, we’ve skipped the bubblegum pop and went straight for bands that aren’t necessarily given the right attention by local radio stations! That’s not to say that most of these acts are unknown, as many of them draw pretty astounding numbers in their respective scenes. We will warn you that many of these bands do actually sing in Maltese, but if the language is completely alien to you, that shouldn’t detract from the catchiness!<strong>

Brikkuni</strong>
Take Brikkuni for example, who have filled quite a few theatres since their inception in 2008. This is a band that has received significant media coverage, but usually for controversial reasons. The latest Brikkuni-related fiasco saw the band getting banned from performing at the annual Farson’s Beerfest after the lead singer had some not-very-nice things to say about a certain political figure (and we’ll leave it at that).
In fact, Brikkuni is not a very shy band, and this is one of their selling points. It is the delight of fans at their gigs to sing along to the cheeky, and often vulgar lyrics.
The band’s new album, <em>Rub Al Khali</em>, marks a departure from the brashness, and fans are going to have to adjust. The band have described the new album as a more sombre, sentimental album that is more challenging to the ear. At the time of writing this article, only the album’s title track has been released. You can listen to it here:<strong>
</strong>
https://brikkuni.bandcamp.com/releases
The good news is that the band has promised that this album will be available to download for free off Bandcamp, meaning that the band has taken a different approach to previous releases in almost every single way. Speaking of which, if you want to hear the difference between <em>Rub Al Khali</em> and the older, folksier Brikkuni sound, most of the band’s repertoire is on Youtube:



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yj-7Uilp5o



<strong>Plato’s Dream Machine

</strong>When Plato’s Dream Machine released their debut album in 2014, we’re not sure that anyone could have anticipated the sounds that would be on it. Once a folk act, the debut album <em>Għera</em> marked a complete shift from that genre. Plato’s Dream Machine took on a Radiohead-like approach with introspective lyrics and an unmistakable, unique charm. Check out <em>Flien</em>, from the first album, to see what we mean:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi5lCDaGXuo


For the new album, which has yet to be titled, the band took advantage of crowdfunding platforms, and it paid off. Though no recorded material has been made available yet, the band has already been playing its new songs live, and they sound just as great as those on <em>Għera</em>. They’re even, dare we say, somewhat poppier! <em>Filgħodu </em>is one of the tracks that we’re really excited about hearing in recorded format:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeUv2EThyLk




<strong>Brodu

</strong>Brodu is another band that released its debut album in 2014, and what an album it was. Titled <em>Ħabullabullojb</em> (don’t worry readers, that’s a made-up word and we can’t wrap our tongues around it either), the album was a seamless display of styles and emotions. Though the lyrics are in Maltese, the music will make you bop your head with feel-good emotions, as well as make you cry your heart out.

Knowing the lyrics help, of course, as they are some of the most mature and beautiful that we’ve read in any language. Singer Mark ‘iz-Zizza’ might not be the greatest singer in the world, but he’s easily one of the most charismatic. Take a song like <em>Iċ-Ċimiterju</em>, where in five minutes he convinces you that cemeteries have less to do with death and much more to do with feeling proximity with people who have passed away.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gq6riex2Iw


Brodu also know how to be upbeat. Check out <em>Kemm Jiena Cool!!</em> from the same album, which cheekily makes fun of faux-activists and anyone else too far up their high horse.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszw0FJHNfk



With such a dynamic array of sounds and themes to look forward to, we’re itching to learn more about the 2017 album. Alas, not much has been revealed yet!

<strong>Fuzzhoneys
</strong>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ-7D_Bu2zg

Fuzzhoneys are the first band on this list to sing in English, but that’s far from being the most exciting thing about them. Their dirty, blues-rock sound is bound to appeal to a wide range of people. The band already has a few songs on Youtube and an EP, <em>CD tal-Ġenn</em>, that was released last year, and although those songs really blend bounciness and grit well, we have reason to believe the full-length album is going to be heaps better!
<strong>Beesqueeze</strong>

Beesqueeze are a rather recent project, having risen from the ashes of now-defunct punk outfit Cable35. Beesqueeze shows a more experiment side to the remaining members, and although the live gigs have proven there’s still plenty of penchant for high-octane energy, there are also some mellower, broodier moments, as you’ll find in the band’s debut single from last year:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfRM8BQz-00


For 2017, Beesqueeze have promised an EP rather than a full-length album, but we’ll happily take it!


<strong>The Ranch

</strong>Though The Ranch are often associated with the jazz scene, the truth is you’ll find every kind of sound seamlessly fused into the eclectic palette of The Ranch. The band’s debut album <em>Cuckoo Island</em>, released in 2015, made waves as one the best instrumental albums to ever grace Malta.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u054z61be4


In 2016, The Ranch saw a pretty significant change in line up, and now the band has a new bassist and guitarist - that’s 2/3 of the group! Yet, the new members have proved that they are more than capable of doing justice to the old material. It was a big year for The Ranch in other ways too, as the band recently embarked on an international tour. What we’re really excited about is how The Ranch (2.0) will approach an album with new material! Luckily, we’ll be able to find out in the coming months.

            [content] => A bunch of rocks piled next to each other can often be unimpressive, unless of course they happen to form a megalithic temple.
Our islands are home to a pretty substantial number of prehistoric temples known collectively as the Megalithic Temples of Malta. There are a number of reasons why you should visit at least some of them during your stay in Malta.

First of all, Malta’s history is definitely one of its most fascinating selling points, as we keep mentioning in our blog posts. The downside to this is that it can definitely be overwhelming to inform yourself of every period of Malta’s very densely-packed story. If you’re going to start anywhere, though, you might as well start at what is literally the beginning.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1783 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/megalithic2.gif" alt="megalithic2.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Yet, the Megalithic Temples of Malta are significant for much more than just Malta’s own history. They’re a big deal for the whole world, and we’re not just waving our flag a little too boldly when we say that. UNESCO actually has several of these structures listed as world heritage sites. The fact is that these temples are some of the oldest free-standing structures of Earth. Built between 3600-700 BC, they are quite the shining example of archaeological innovation in prehistorical eras.
It’s not just the stone structures that are fascinating, though impressive they indeed are. It’s what they represent that really speaks to visitors –that in all facets of history the same questions of spirituality are asked, and that cultures inevitably revolve around those questions no matter how ‘evolved’ that culture happens to be. A trip to the Megalithic temples is not likely to offer any real answers, but it is sure to provide a resonance that you might not find in most other places.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1785" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/megalithic3.gif" alt="megalithic3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
If you’re looking for that resonance, or if you simply want to immerse yourself in these important remains from history, visiting the megalithic temples is an easy process. Read on to discover a bit more about some of the most well-known temples in Malta – but of course, we won’t give away all the secrets. You’ll have to unravel more as you explore the sites first-hand.

<strong>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a> Temples</strong>
The first temples on the list are actually located in Gozo - Xagħra, to be precise. If you think that a trip to Gozo just to see these temples might be a waste of your time (a trip to Gozo is never a waste of time, but we digress), let us persuade you otherwise.
In fact, we’d go as far as to say that if you can only make time for one group of temples during your stay in Malta, this should probably be it. These temples are both the oldest and the largest in Malta. In fact, the name ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a>’ actually comes from the word Giant, as it was a Maltese folklore tale that the Megalithic temples were actually built by the giants.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1787 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/megalithic4.gif" alt="megalithic4.gif" width="250" height="141" />
The two temples that make up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a> have been extremely well preserved, making it really possible to understand the details of the furnishings and structure. From apses to altars, from animal bones to libation holes, there will be no doubt in your mind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a>’s significance as a place of worship and sacrifice.
<strong>Ħaġar Qim and the Mnajdra Temples</strong>
Located in Qrendi, this is another temple with interesting etymology, as the name more or less translates into ‘Stones of Worship’.
Ħaġar Qim is well-known for its particular structure, involving a central building and two lesser structures. What is most interesting is the use of C-shaped apses that make up the rooms of the temple. However, much intrigue has also been raised due to the discovery of high altar-tables, as well as statuettes of obese figures (often considered to be the Maltese goddess of fertility).

Just 500 metres away are the Mnajdra Temples, which is perhaps best-known for its southern temple which is ingeniously designed to align with the rising run during solstices and equinoxes. In other words, during the summer solstice the first rays of sun light up the megalith between the first apses, while during the winter equinox the same happens to the opposing apse.
<strong>Ta' Ħaġrat and Skorba Temples</strong>
We’re placing these two temples together because there’s only a kilometre between them! That doesn’t mean you should see these as the same structure because they are both beautiful for their own reasons.
Ta’ Ħaġrat temple in Mġarr is made up of two temples, yet is one of the smaller Neolithic structures in Malta. It’s biggest claim to fame is the discovery of beautiful Mġarr phase pottery in the surrounding village.
The Skorba site is perhaps not as preserved as some other structures, but it has been a fascinating source of information nonetheless. What we do know about Skorba is that it was revisited in later eras of prehistory. As a result, one can find both the remnants of the Ġgantija era, namely the three-apsed shape of the Ġgantija phase, as well as later monuments introduced in the Tarxien phase.
<strong>The Tarxien Temples and the Hypogeum </strong>
Both the Tarxien Temples and the Hypogeum were located in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, which is apt considering that there is only around 400 metres between them. Both are impressive sites in their own right, and the Tarxien Temples deserve their due attention for being a shining example of Tarxien phase building, complete with detailed carvings into the walls.
Yet, these temples do tend to get slightly overshadowed by the Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni, and perhaps understandably considering that it is the only known underground prehistoric temple in the world. Entrance to the Hypogeum is somewhat exclusive – anyone can get in, but the site only accepts 80 people a day, so you might need to book your tour well in advance. The experience is well worth it, though.

Consisting of three distinct levels, the Hypogeum is a stunning representation of everything that makes Maltese Megalithic Temples wondrous, from the burial chambers, to the red ochre spiral paintings on the walls.

            [content] => It might seem like an odd thing to say, but pastizzi are one of the cornerstones of Maltese culture. Their aroma scents every other street due to the abundance of pastizzeriji in Malta; they’re eaten at literally every single time of day, from breakfast to dinner to 5 a.m. after wild nights out; and they’re one of the first things that any newcomer to Malta will inevitably hear about.

So sampling a pastizz (or two, or three) is a must when in Malta, and that’s non-negotiable. Sure, these inexpensive, flaky pastries are far from being the healthiest thing around, but that’s why you’ll have to simply consider them as sinful treats and show some self-restraint with them!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1794 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pastizzi2.gif" alt="pastizzi2.gif" width="500" height="330" />
Don’t bite blindly into your first pastizz, though! This article will tell you everything you need to know about this local scrumptious snack.
<strong>There are more flavours now than tradition suggests
</strong><strong>
</strong>Pastizzi are traditionally known for coming in one of two main fillings: pea (pastizzi tal-pizelli) and ricotta cheese (pastizzi tar-rikotta). These have been the two staple pastizzi flavours for years and years, and even now they’re easily the most popular and common variations around.

However, if you’re looking for more adventurous pastizzi, you’re in luck, as quite a few pastizzeriji have decided to introduce some newer variations. Chicken pastizzi are growing in popularity, and if you look hard enough you’ll even find rabbit and peppered steak pastizzi!

The steady rise of Nutella pastizzi has furthermore challenged the idea that pastizzi have to be a savoury treat!
<strong>Pastizzi come in different types</strong>

Pastizzi are most commonly made with philo-pastry, resulting in its iconic flaky texture. If you prefer something a bit less messy, though, you can also find pastizzi made with puff pastry. These are known as pastizzi tax-xema, and are no less delicious!

If you’re looking for something somewhat more substantial when you have a pastizzi craving, you could also opt for an qassata, which is a kind of larger, rounder pastry (a bit like a small pie) that is made of puff pastry and contains the same fillings you’ll get with regular pastizzi. Qassatat are also commonly filled with spinach (and sometimes anchovies).

<strong>You can get them at all kinds of vendors</strong>

Sure, pastizzi might be most commonly associated with street pastizzeriji like Maxims, Champs, Sphinx, and so on (we can’t mention every single known pastizzerija – it’s impossible). While it’s very possible to get your pastizzi-fix on the go thanks to these places, there are other options you can check out.

Pastizzi are also commonly served at cafés, restaurants, and similar venues. In fact, perhaps the most famous place in Malta to get pastizzi from is the Crystal Palace in Rabat (known as is-Serkin), and that’s actually a bar you can sit at.

Eating at such places could be your preferred option as you can sit comfortably while indulging. It’s also likely that (depending on where you eat at) the pastizzi from restaurants will be a little healthier than the ones you’d get at street vendors. Just a few sit-down places to get pastizzi from are Café Jubilee, Il-Kikkra Café, Mr Maxims Jr Café, and Peristyle.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>What do you mean pastizzi can be gourmet?</strong>

Eating pastizzi at a restaurant is one thing. Eating pastizzi that the Queen of England could enjoy is another.

Pastizzi Gourmet is the brainchild of Marilu Vella, who has made ingenious steps with the idea that pastizzi can come in an assortment of flavours while still being guilt-free. The pastries you’d get at Pastizzi Gourmet are low-fat and home-made. In fact, you need to contact Marilu in advance (or go to Flora’s café in Naxxar), pick up your preferred batch, and cook them yourself. It’s completely worth it.

You don’t really go to Pastizzi Gourmet for the standard flavours. In fact, even the classics have been updated here (with variations like ‘pea and mint’). The focus here is on more unique takes on the pastizzi. The menu does change every now and then, but just to get an idea, Pastizzi Gourmet offer (or have offered in the past) gozo cheeselet, peppered pumpkin, snail, and tortilla de patatas amp; chorizo pastizzi – just to name a few!

You can even get dessert pastizzi, and the flavours here too are changed up often. Strawberry amp; chocolate were once made for Valentine’s, apple amp; Cinnamon for Lent, and blueberry amp; strawberry for election season!

<strong>
You don’t just need to be in Malta to have them</strong>

Here’s the really good news – though Pastizzi are definitely a Maltese phenomenon, you can find pastizzeriji all over the world! This is due to Maltese emigration, so pastizzi are most common in areas like Canada, Australia, and the UK.

            [content] => There are several things about Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum that make it worthy of the rave reviews it constantly gets on Trip Advisor. Located in Mdina, it seamlessly combines the authenticity of the museum experience with the feel and setting of a lavish private home.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1807" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/snuff1.jpg" alt="snuff1.jpg" width="400" height="302" />

It’s not just a pretty structure, though – Palazzo Falson’s collections (of which there are 45 in total) are some of the most coveted in Malta, with an impressive display of everything from Oriental rugs to silverware and all else in between. The museum also houses a special library consisting of over 4,500 books and special manuscripts.
Palazzo Falson is also known for its frequent special exhibitions that showcase specific items alongside several gallery talks and other educational programmes. Previous years have seen exhibitions on whistles, pipes, scent bottle bottles, antique watches, and even a whole dedication on English artist Edward Lear.
Its current exhibition, titled <em>Snuff Boxes: From Accessories to Objets D'art</em>, has actually been open to the public since last December, but you’re still well in time to pay a visit. The exhibition will keep running till the 26<sup>th</sup> of February, giving you just around a month and a half to immerse yourself in this snuffbox experience.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1810" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/snuff2.gif" alt="snuff2.gif" width="480" height="366" />
Furthermore, the exhibition runs every week from Tuesday to Sunday, between 10 am and 4.30 pm. Not great hours for anyone working a fulltime job, but if you’re just visiting Malta on holiday or are working more flexible hours, it really is a must see, and you could make it a single stop into a whole day trip to Mdina. If you need even further motive, the exhibition is completely free of charge!
So why look at snuffboxes, of all things? Sure, the Palazzo Falson exhibition perfectly captures this historical fascination with a kind of item that might seem somewhat outdated in today’s context. Yet this is not simply a case of putting the spotlight on an item which is not commonplace anymore. The fact of the matter is that these decorative boxes have always been artistic wonders as much as they have been practical tools.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1812" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/snuff3.gif" alt="snuff3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
If the 200 snuff boxes Palazzo Falson has put together for this exhibition won’t convince you of that, nothing will! While many of these snuff boxes have been sourced from other museums, some of them have been gathered from private collections, meaning that Palazzo Falson is giving a first-time look into some historically noteworthy items. Other related artefacts contextualising the history of the snuffbox will also be on display.
This stunning display is a treat in itself, but the really ardent history fans might need their appetites for knowledge satiated even further. Thanks to a series of gallery talks being given in conjunction with the exhibition, this too in possible! Taking place at the museum itself are a total of three talks – one per month. The December talk has already been given, of course, but do remember to check out the next ones, as they are happening on the 20<sup>th</sup> of January and 17<sup>th</sup> of February, respectively.

            [content] => Most of our articles have to do with things to do and see in Malta. In other words, what and where the hotspots and must-visits are.
This article is a bit different; a little bit more on the informative side of things. You might have heard that Malta is currently undertaking the presidency role of the Council of the EU. That might sound pretty fancy (even if you don’t know the implications of that are), but we’re here to explain why exactly this is a big deal for Malta, and why you automatically get bragging rights for being in Malta during this exciting time, whether you’re a citizen or visitor!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1818" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/maltaeu1.gif" alt="maltaeu1.gif" width="480" height="360" />
You might have also heard that in 2018, Valletta will be the Cultural Capital for Europe. Because this coincides so closely with Malta’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, many people are lumping them together. Before we get further into this article, we just want to stress that they’re actually two separate things, although the pairing of the two together has certainly led to an abundance of new cultural opportunities in Malta (but that’s an article for the future!).
The idea that the presidency of the EU Council should be divided amongst the different member states is relatively a rather new idea in terms of legislation. In fact, it only dates back to the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The thought-process behind this practise is that every country that handles the presidency role can offer something new to the working dynamic and scope of the EU, while further providing stability to the democratic and balanced principles upheld by the institution.
What you might not know about this arrangement is that Malta is not technically handling the role in isolation. Rather, what is implemented is a Trio Presidency dynamic is which three different member states of the EU liaise together over an 18<sup>th</sup> month period. The current Trio Presidency is made up of Malta, The Netherlands, and Slovakia.
What changes is that with every 6-month period there is a shift of the dominant presiding country, and from the 1<sup>st</sup> of January till the 30<sup>th</sup> of June 2017 the spotlight is on Malta. The chosen site to run the presidency from is the Grand Master’s Palace in Valletta, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a design that dates as far back as 1571. It has a rich political history even prior to its 2017 role. First used as the official residence of the Knights of St. John, and later the house of the British Governor, the Palace eventually became Malta’s first house of Representatives after the island achieved independence.
This is all well and good, but what does this mean for Malta and the EU, exactly? Here is a list of things you can expect for Malta during the first half of 2017:
<strong>A Unique Theme</strong>
For its Presidency, Malta has selected the theme of rEUnion. More than a clever pun, rEUnion represents the importance of European connectivity, and further challenging the limits of what a European citizen is defined by.  As the Presidency has stated itself, rEUnion is not simply about legislation, but is rather much more challenging European ideologies and lifestyles. In other words, the Presidency doesn’t claim to be able to achieve the whole of this scope in just 6 months – but it certainly aims to get the vehicle rolling.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1820" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/maltaeu2.gif" alt="maltaeu2.gif" width="480" height="258" />
<strong>A Set of Unique Goals</strong>
A theme like rEUnion of course comes with a very particular set of challenges. One of these challenges concerns a very pressing European issue, namely migration. The Malta Presidency seeks to sow the seeds to create a more holistic approach to migration, with aims such as strengthening the quality of the Common European Asylum System and improved load-sharing.
This issue of migration will be tackled in addition to other important ones, such as European security and further economic development such as through the positive exploitation of the Single Market.
<strong>
New Cultural Opportunities</strong>
The Malta Presidency of the Council of the EU is not about Malta, of course – it’s about the benefit of the EU. However, for anyone who may happen to be in Malta during this period, there is quite a lot to look forward to in terms of cultural events. One which we’re particularly excited about is Ode to Joy: A Citizen Orchestra.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DkPeTyqd1s
Taking place on the 14<sup>th</sup> of May at the Royal Theatre Square, the orchestra is a collaboration between conductor Tim Steiner, Ricardo Baptista, and everybody who wants to take part. The Citizen Orchestra is exactly that – an orchestra that every Maltese citizen, musically trained or not, can take part in. It’s a way of offering a new, dynamic take on music, and is looking to be a rousing show for spectators as well as a unique opportunity for citizens.

            [content] => This year, Carnival is taking place between the 24<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> of February, making this article a month early in the calendar. You might be perplexed by this, but considering how seriously the Maltese take Carnival, with some diehards working towards the event all year round, an announcement just a month prior sounds just about right!



<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1827" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/carnival2.jpg" alt="carnival2.jpg" width="612" height="340" />
<em>Photo credit: www.epicurious.com</em>
Indeed, Carnival has a rich history in Malta, having been celebrated at least since the arrival of the Knights of St John in 1535. Some newer sources even suggest that Carnival celebrations predate this era, and go back all the way to 1470.

‘Carnival is a big deal in most countries around the world’, you might be thinking. ‘What makes Carnival in Malta worth visiting above what we’d find elsewhere?’

It’s a fair question, but the fact of the matter is that carnival isn’t a competition. Malta might not have the same carnival that somewhere like Rio does – but Rio doesn’t have the same carnival that Malta does, and that’s perfectly OK. They can both be carnivals worth experiencing! However, this article is all about Maltese Carnival, and what makes it unique. Read on to find out what’s worth checking out should you be in our archipelago this February.

You might already have anticipated this, but Valletta is the main axis around which Carnival in Malta rotates. This is not simply the case because Valletta is our capital city though, but rather because the tradition of Carnival stems all the way to the time of the Knights of the Order of St. John (as mentioned), and this city was their official residence during the majority of their stay.

In other words, Valletta is the place to be if you want to find all kinds of people, from children to the elderly. More importantly, though, it’s the place to be if you want to experience the real Carnival tradition in Malta, complete with singing, dancing, music, food, games, and carnival floats.

The carnival floats, of course, are the real point of intrigue year after year for anybody visiting Valletta. Always whacky and over-the-top, Maltese Carnival Floats can cover a wide range of themes and people, which means that the team responsible for making them doesn’t even mind poking fun at local politicians and personalities at times! Current Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, for example, is just one of the several people who has been turned into a float before.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1829 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/carnival3.jpg" alt="carnival3.jpg" width="620" height="413" />

If you’re not Maltese, you might need a friend to help you understand all the references used for the floats, but it’s all in good fun! Either way, you can appreciate them simply for the impressive construction work and fine detail, whether you catch them as they parade in Valletta, or whether you inspect them as they’re at a standstill.

Another Carnival tradition that takes place in Valletta and is definitely worth checking out is a dance known as ‘Il-Parata’. Dating back to the times of the Knights, this dance re-enacts the 1565 siege between the Maltese and the Ottoman Empire. For many years, it was considered to be the most essential part of the festivities. This dance was revived in 2006, and nowadays it is mostly children who participate.

If you’re in the mood for a more adult, more macabre carnival, your best solution is to get to Nadur in Gozo, which has long become recognised as the other hotspot for the feast in the Maltese Islands. More child-friendly celebrations take place in Victoria, Gozo’s capital city, but you’ll definitely want to call the babysitter if you’re planning to head on down to Nadur, where you’ll find a real party vibe. Here, people tend to don costumes that range from ghoulish to somewhat explicit. It’s definitely a place where people can let loose and forget their concerns!

Where will you be this carnival? Are you interested in the traditional Valletta carnival way of doing things, or are you more of a Nadur person? There’s plenty of time to find out – just don’t miss out on the festivities this year!

            [content] => When you next fancy a walk in Malta, skip the greener areas and instead opt for a stroll in one of Malta’s seaside cities, like Marsaxlokk. You’ll inevitably be enthralled by the abundance of boats everywhere – boats that you might only have seen before on postcards.

We’re not talking about luxurious yachts and speed boats, but rather Maltese traditional boats. This article is going to delve into the common types of traditional boats you’ll find in Malta, but if after reading you find yourself craving a bit more knowledge, there’s one event you really need to get to.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1837 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu6.gif" alt="luzzu6" width="384" height="270" />

That event, organised by Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, is taking place on the 9<sup>th</sup> of February, and is a talk aptly titled ‘The Boats of Malta’. Delivered by Professor Anthony Aquilina, the talk is the result of research by world-famous anthropologist Desmond Morris, who actually resided in Malta for 6 years. Morris’ study was lost for decades and rediscovered recently, which makes the February event a special one indeed.

Professor Aquilina’s talk, which will be held at the Palazzo de la Salle, is guaranteed to be a fascinating insight into the tradition and deep history of one of Malta’s national icons, so for more information about how to reserve a seat check out <a href="http://new.faa.org.mt/events/">new.faa.org.mt/events</a> and <a href="http://www.ticketengine.faa.org.mt">www.ticketengine.faa.org.mt</a>.

Before deciding if that talk is for you or not, though, read through this article. Consider it to be an informal introduction to Maltese boats of sorts! There won’t be a test afterwards, but you will be able to impress your friends and family by schooling them on everything you know a-boat the subject! Your main interest at this point will be to learn how to distinguish between the following types of boats:

<strong>Luzzu</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1839 alignright" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu2.jpg" alt="luzzu2.jpg" width="844" height="633" />











Luzzus are probably Malta’s most well-known boat, which is not surprising considering their unique appearance. This traditional fishing boat is always coloured in bright shades of blue, yellow, green and red, and its bow always dons its most distinctive feature: a pair of eyes. The eye, known as the Eye of Horus or the Eye of Osiris, is traditionally said to protect fishermen at sea.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1841" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu3.jpg" alt="luzzu3.jpg" width="642" height="485" />


Luzzus are commonly used as fishing vessels, although you might be lucky enough to find one that is also used as a passenger vessel. These boats are believed to have been around since ancient times, so it’s not surprising that some changes can be noted throughout history. The most obvious one of these is that luzzus are now motorised, whereas in the past they would have sails. Nowadays, in fact, it is quite rare to see a luzzu with a sail!
Though the double-hulled luzzu itself predates the language, the name derives from the Sicilian <em>guzzu</em>, which is a type of transport and fishing vessel in itself. The Maltese luzzu is its own creation, though, with unique customs associated with it. For example, when a member of a fishing family passes away, this is marked on the boat itself as a small homage.
<strong>Dgħajsa

</strong>

Though <em>dgħajsa</em> is actually the general Maltese word for boat, when one talks about the Maltese dgħajsa then he is referring a kind of water taxi that is specific to our islands. Like the luzzu, the dgħajsa is believed to date back to Phoenician times. Truly a Maltese symbol, the dgħajsa appeared on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Malta#Coat_of_Arms_used_between_1975_and_1988">coat of arms of Malta</a> from 1975 to 1988.

In many ways a take on the gondola, the Maltese Dgħajsa was mostly used in the Grand Harbour area, but of course could be found all over Malta. Such is the case that the different colours used to decorate the boats were often chosen based on the different harbours they were used at. Today, few remaining dgħajsas (or dgħajjes in Maltese) survive as functioning water taxis, but some are still used as transportation between Birgu and Valletta.
<strong>Other kinds of Maltese boats</strong>

Though not as common as the Luzzu and Dgħajsa, there are a few other Maltese boats that are certainly worthy of mention, including:
<ul>
	<li>The Kajjik, which is in many ways a smaller luzzu but has a square transom instead of a double ended-hull</li>
	<li>The Gozo boat (now largely extinct) which is more or less a larger luzzu with lateen sails</li>
	<li>The Dgħajsa tal-Midalji, a more modern version of the Dgħajsa which is often used in the local Regatta rowing race</li>
</ul>

            [content] => On this blog, we love to emphasise time and again just how great Malta’s live music scene is. 2017’s first few months are already looking to be extremely vibrant in terms of concerts, with a rich mix of local and foreign acts promising to leave their mark all over our shores (Iron Maiden’s ex-singer, Blaze Bailey, is one such act, and you don’t need to be a spandex-wearing rocker to find that exciting).

However, because our affinity lies with all things Maltese, this article is going to focus specifically on a local band, nosnow/noalps, that will be celebrating its 10-year anniversary just a few days later on the 17<sup>th</sup> of February. Taking place at The Palace Theatre in Paola, the concert is titled ‘Moving Mountains – 10 Years of nosnow/noalps’. Tickets are priced at €12 per seat or €15 at special tables seating four. You can find much more information at the event page <strong>here</strong>.

‘Iron Maiden, nosnow/noalps are not’, you might be thinking. ‘What makes this Maltese band worth my time?’ For anybody who might be new to the Maltese music scene, it’s a fair question. If you were to dig just a little deeper, though, you’d find out that nosnow/noalps are one of the more important bands in the Maltese rock scene.

The band formed in 2007, and released its debut EP, <em>(just rock),</em> a year later. Whether the choice of title was ironic or not is uncertain, but what is certain that <em>(just rock)</em> is definitely not a straightforward rock EP. A benchmark for the trademark nosnow/noalps sound, <em>(just rock)</em> featured bouncy guitar riffs, but these were coupled with poppy, catchy vocals (both male and female) and ska/reggae-influenced rhythms. Check out the trademark single from this era, Taking My Time, to see just what we mean:



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhf6ko4K_kU



It’s not surprising, then, that when nosnow/noalps began making waves, they were waves that stuck. The band had a distinctive sound that was unique without being cluttered - rooted enough in the rock genre to make your head bop but diverse enough to stray away from the conventions of the genre.

When the band entered the studio to record its first full-length album in 2010, expectations were high. Those expectations were met in the form of ROMANTIKPOLITIK, an album that is still considered to be a favourite in the local scene today. The release not only captured the sound that fans had come to expect from the band, but it presented it in a more mature, 14-track format. Notable singles from this time, to name a few, include Far into the Night (Without You) and Elizabeth, I.

After that, the band entered a new era, with a few notable line-up changes and a move to Denmark that lasted a good few months. The result of that new life was <em>Go Go Go Go</em>, the band’s 3rd release, launched in 2014. With this album, nosnow/noalps did the smart thing and evolved its sound slightly. Flourishes of <em>ROMANTIKPOLITIK</em> are evident, of course, but the album is far from <em>ROMANTIKPOLITIK PT. 2.</em> Indeed, one pleasant surprise on the album is the inclusion of more aggressive and punky influences on certain tracks, such as <em>Black Panther</em>, which has a nice amount of grit while still being a danceable party song.

Unfortunately, fans have to wait a little bit for news regarding a new album, but Kaleidoscopes, a mesmerising single released in 2015 scratched the itch for a good while. Featuring dreamy guitar tones and a heavy emphasis on trumpet, Kaleidoscopes is one of the band’s strongest songs yet – but that’s only whet our collective appetite for even more new material.

The 17th of February is not about new material, though. Rather, it’s about celebrating the rich discography that nosnow/noalps has given us in its current 10-year old story. Such is the case that the band will be accompanied by numerous guests, many of whom can be directly traced to the band’s history.

Let’s turn back to the question we posed at the beginning of this article: ‘What makes nosnow/noalps worth your time?’

Here, we’re not simply dealing with a Maltese band that has been around for 10 years. There are plenty of those already. Rather, this is a band that has done a whole lot in those 10 years. With a handful of releases and even more anthems that are iconic on a local level, nosnow/noalps is a band that represents the pinnacle of creativity and hard work in the Maltese music scene. If that’s not worth your time, we don’t know what is.

            [content] => It’s hard to pin down what makes Carnival such a lovable exercise in festivities, year after year. To anyone with a bout of scepticism, Carnival can seem rowdy, loud, gaudy and wild. To the optimistic eye, that is precisely the point – Carnival is not like any other time of the year. It’s a colourful spectrum of letting loose and celebration, and maybe the fact that it inspires so much joy to people of all ages is a telling sign that we need to add some more colour to our daily routine.

That doesn’t mean we’d vouch for more frequent carnivals, though! Just like how the magic of Christmas presents would be lost if we received them every day, the traditions of Carnival are special because you’re not going to find them regularly in Malta. This is especially true of the special confectionaries and sweets that become available in Malta and Gozo during the Carnival period.

These sweet treats are absolutely heavenly, but would you want them to be available all year round? Instinctively, we’d shout a resounding yes – but the truth is that waiting for the whole year to pass so that you can get your hands on a portion on these scrumptious goods makes them taste even better!

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1865" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats.jpg?w=300" alt="treats" width="300" height="234" />



If you’re new to Maltese Carnival, though, you’re probably not partaking in the collective mouth-watering just yet. What are these magical carnival treats, and where can one find them? The answer to the second question is quite simply ‘everywhere’, but the first requires a bit more depth. Luckily for you, we’re providing the answer throughout the rest of the article.

The first thing to stress here is that if you go to just about any place celebrating Carnival this year, you’re going to find the usual street vendors selling an assortment of sugary goods, like ice creams and doughnuts. That’s not we mean when we’re talking about traditional carnival treats, of course! Delicious as they might be, if you’re looking to sample our more traditional offerings, try out some of the below:

<strong>Prinjolata</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1861" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats1.jpg" alt="treats1.jpg" width="459" height="306" />

If we were to conduct a poll asking which Carnival treat was the overall favourite, we’re sure that Prinjolata would take the cake. Often considered to be the quintessential Carnival treat, this would be the one to sample if you could only limit yourself to one sweet (but why torture yourself like that?).

Prinjolata is a kind of cake that is made first by blending ‘pan di spagna’ sponge with cocoa nibs, pine nuts, and cherries. That is the body of the cake, and it is then covered in succulent cream, drizzled melted chocolate, and more cherries. You don’t need us to tell you it’s not the best cake to eat on a diet. Indeed, ‘sinful’ and ‘decadent’ are two great words to choose when describing prinjolata cakes, but arguably that just makes them even more appropriate as a pre-Lent indulgence!



<strong>Perlini</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1862" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats2.jpg" alt="treats2.jpg" width="350" height="263" />

Simply put, perlini are almonds cased in a strong sugar coating. They’re colourful and definitely will hit the spot if you find yourself craving that sugary, nutty taste, but we would like to offer a word of caution first: perlini are usually quite hard. Biting into them is definitely not the wisest choice – instead opt for sucking on them till they soften up.

It might seem like a silly or even obvious thing to say – however, perlini are mostly enjoyed by children, so passing on the message to your kids is a simple way of avoiding unexpected and unwanted trips to the dentist this Carnival!

We’re not trying to diss perlini, of course – they’re great fun in their sweet simplicity. They also have a very particular place in Maltese Carnival history. Perlini used to be thrown to children by people on top of the carnival floats.



<strong>Sfrappole (and similar Sicilian treats)</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1863" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats3.jpg" alt="treats3.jpg" width="620" height="465" />

Because of Malta’s proximity to Sicily, you’ll find a few places offering some of Sicily’s coveted Carnival treats. One such treat is ‘Sfrappole’, and is simply fried dough that is sprinkled with powdered sugar. It might sound underwhelming and simple, but it’s quite delicious – think of it as kannoli (another popular treat in Malta) pastry without the ricotta filling!

            [content] => Shipwrecks are tragedies, of course, unless they somehow manage to instil a new religious faith to an entire nation for centuries to come. That’s how the story goes in Malta – St. Paul, now the Patron Saint of Malta, landed on our islands after a divinely fated shipwreck, and the rest is history.

To commemorate the event, The Feast of St. Paul’s Shipwreck is celebrated every year in Malta on the 10<sup><span style="font-size:small;">th</span></sup> of February. Though this is one of the most important days in any Maltese religious devotee’s calendar, the day can be appreciated by people holding any beliefs – and not just for the long weekend that’s coming their way, either.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1873 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/stpaul1.jpg" alt="stpaul1" width="540" height="340" />
<em>Photo credit: </em><a href="http://www.palazzoconsiglia.com/"><em>www.palazzoconsiglia.com</em></a>
The Feast of St. Paul’s Shipwreck is about the entirety of the Catholic Faith in Malta, but the implications here are much more than religious. Catholicism has such a huge cultural hold in Malta that to celebrate St. Paul’s shipwreck is also a way of celebrating its effects on a historical level, architectural level, and so on.

<strong>How the story goes: </strong>St. Paul allegedly landed in Malta in 60 AD, making Malta’s introduction to Christianity one of the earliest on a global scale. Showing the way of Christ to the Maltese wasn’t exactly St. Paul’s (back then known simply as Paul), though.

Paul was actually on the way to Rome against his will – he was going to be on trial for crimes against the Roman Empire for attempting to convert people to Christianity. However, the ship got caught in a storm, with the result being that two weeks later the ship was wrecked on the Maltese coast.

If that didn’t sound enough like a pretty bad weekend, Paul was later bit by a poisonous snake after the Maltese welcomed him and his peers around a fire. Here’s the thing though – Paul didn’t incur any illness as a result. We reckon that this is the time that the Maltese started taking Paul and his message a little bit more seriously.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1876 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/stpaul2.jpg" alt="stpaul2.jpg" width="1024" height="660" />L<em>aurent de La Hyre’s ‘Saint Paul Shipwrecked on Malta’, 1630</em>

After that, Paul stayed in Malta for quite a while longer, initially taking refuge in a cave in Rabat that is today known as St. Paul’s Grotto (to this day, Rabat is still one of the areas that is most associated with the Feast of Saint Paul’s Shipwreck). However, he eventually stayed at the house of Publius, who was the Roman chief of the islands. It was here that Paul allegedly worked a little bit more miracle magic by curing Publius of a fatal fever. Publius then converted to Christianity and became the first bishop of Malta, directing the faith of the Maltese after Paul left the islands.

<strong>Is St. Paul’s story Gospel truth? </strong> Even from a non-religious perspective, strong evidence seems to suggest that St. Paul did land in Malta, particularly because of the fact that there is archaeological proof that Malta was one of the first Roman colonies to adopt Christianity. On the other hand, some historians believe that St. Paul landed on an island closer to Greece. Ultimately, as is the case with most biblical stories, we’ll never really know – you either accept it or you don’t. The majority of the Maltese certainly do, so you might want to avoid stating controversial opinions within earshot!
<strong>What can you do on the 10<sup>th</sup> of February?</strong>

There are a few options if you want to join in on the celebrations. A special mass is heard all around the island, but you could opt to go to The Parish Church of Saint Paul in Rabat or the Church of Saint Paul’s Shipwreck in Valletta.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1881" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/stpaul3.jpg" alt="stpaul3.jpg" width="1254" height="836" /><em>The Church of Saint Paul’s Shipwreck, Valletta
</em>

If you opt to go to Rabat, you could then visit Saint Paul’s Grotto, which as mentioned Saint Paul is said to have taken refuge in. Afterwards you could opt to eat at one of the many wonderful restaurants in the vicinity.

If you go to Valletta, there’s quite a bit of activity to look forward to. The church itself is a work of beauty and is home to several ancient relics and artefacts pertaining to Saint Paul, including his wrist bone. After the mass you could witness the procession of Saint Paul’s statue from the church through the streets of Valletta. This procession is of course accompanied by lots of confetti, marching band music, and overall liveliness. For the early birds, fireworks are exploded over the Grand Harbour after the 8 am mass in Valletta!

            [content] => Valentine’s Day is around the corner. Whether you’re planning to spend the day with your wife, long-term girlfriend, new lover, or someone you’re simply testing the waters with, you might be wondering how you’re going to impress your partner. How are you going to sweep them off their feet and whisk them into your arms if you don’t plan the perfect Valentine’s date?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1894 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine.gif" alt="valentine" width="600" height="360" />

Hold on for a second, though. Remember that you’re in <em>Malta</em>, one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Sure, you can go the expensive route and book an expensive restaurant or hotel, and we’re pretty sure that you’ll have an incredible Valentine’s day.

However, if you really want to make the most out of the fact that you’re in Malta, you could instead opt to spend the day with a picnic at one of the most scenic landscapes our islands have to offer (and if you’re cheesy enough, you could take the opportunity to compare your partner to the breath-taking views around you. We promise it will work.)

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1897" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine2.gif" alt="valentine2.gif" width="480" height="360" />

Spending Valentine’s day in nature isn’t just more beautiful and poetic – it’s also much more personal. Forget the noise and background chattering that you get in restaurants and similar areas. Your special day should be private and intimate – shared only by you, your lover, and the wind and trees around you. The personal quality of your date will be highlighted with your choice of picnic foods. Sure, top-tier restaurants know how to cook amazing food, and they’ll know how to create a special menu that really sets the mood for Valentine’s day. You know what they don’t know, though? The unique relationship you and your partner share. Try cooking each other’s favourite foods, or creating a surprise menu for each other. Alternatively, take the opportunity to break out Maltese aphrodisiac foods, like our superb local honey!

Without further ado, here a few places to choose from when planning your perfect Valentine’s Day picnic. If you plan on making it a total surprise, do keep in mind that some of these areas are pretty cliffy, so we’d suggest not going so far as to use a blindfold.

<strong>Ta’ Qali National Park, Attard</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1899 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine11.jpg" alt="valentine1" width="1024" height="768" />

This park is a first-choice Sunday afternoon location for many families, but it can work just as well as a Romantic Valentine’s spot. Valentine’s is happening on a Tuesday this year, so if you’re faithful to the date it’ll probably be much quieter than usual. However, if you do keep your plans for the weekend you might find quite a few kids bustling about in the grass. On the plus side (and we think this is a huge plus), you’ll probably also get to meet a few family dogs as a result.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buskett_Gardens"><strong>Buskett Gardens</strong></a><strong>, Siġġiewi </strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1901" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine2.jpg" alt="valentine2.jpg" width="800" height="531" />

Allegedly, in the time of the Romans, Buskett Gardens was used as a site for sexual activity in order to celebrate their gods. In other words, it’s already been tried and tested as a perfect location for Valentine’s Day! Of course, we don’t condone getting that frisky in any public area.

Located in Siġġiewi, Buskett Gardens is a gorgeous woodlands site that has been given a lot of attention throughout history, particularly by the Knights of St John who planted various gardens in the area. As a result, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more gorgeous location for your special picnic, especially if you’re looking for shade.

Wied il-Għasel, Mosta

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1903 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine3.jpg" alt="valentine3.jpg" width="500" height="375" />

Wied il-Għasel is perfect for trekking, but you’ll definitely want to watch your step here. It’s a large, spacious area, making it excellent for finding an intimate spot where you can spend time with your partner undisturbed. The fact that one of the most beautiful songs to ever come out of Malta is written about it is a huge plus.

Picnics are allowed here, but do make sure you clean up and barbecues are definitely a no-no (to be fair, this is the case with all the areas on this list). Lots of environmental concern has been raised over Wied il-Għasel in recent years, and such a gorgeous spot should be respected.

<strong>Chadwick Lakes, Mtarfa</strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1905 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine4.jpg" alt="valentine4.jpg" width="960" height="720" />

Located in Mtarfa, Chadwick Lakes forms the longest valley in Malta, and is made up of a number of dams constructed by Sir Osbert Chadwick during the period of the British Empire. Can you think of anything more romantic than spending an evening next to so many lakes? We didn’t think so!

<strong>Għajn Tuffieħa, or any other beach</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1906" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine5.jpg" alt="valentine5.jpg" width="595" height="324" />

If you like the idea of a picnic but aren’t too keen on grassy fields and rocky areas, choose from one of the uncountable amount of beaches we have in Malta! Do, of course, keep in mind that if you have your picnic at night, it will get pretty chilly since you’ll be next to the sea, but that would just give you extra incentive to snuggle up with your loved one.

            [content] => It’s easy to get trapped into a routine with no exercise in it. It’s only February, and you might be one of the hundreds of people who already have new-year-resolution gym membership cards that are gathering dust.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/marathon.gif" alt="marathon.gif" width="600" height="600" />

We’re not judging. Having to juggle between work and your busy life outside it can make you lose sight of the treadmill. In addition to this, when you spend time in another country, the last thing you’re likely to think about is working out – with all the places to see and all the foods to try, you might quickly find your waistline expanding.
The Vodafone Malta Marathon, an annual event, gives you the opportunity to exercise with a greater purpose in mind, so it’s time to shed your excuses (and possibly a few pounds while you’re at it).
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1917" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/marathon2.gif" alt="marathon2.gif" width="335" height="335" />

This year, all the proceeds collected through the marathon will go the Inspire Foundation, a charity which works with people who suffer from Down Syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy, and various other disabilities.

If you’re more interested in the competitive edge, you’re in luck too, as an award ceremony is hosted on the same day at 8.30 pm at Le Méridien, St Julians Hotel amp; Spa. Winning categories include 1st 3 Men, 1st 3 Ladies, 1st 3 Male Teams, and 1st 3 Female teams.

If you’re up for the good deed, the Vodafone Malta Marathon is happening on the 5th of March this year. People are still in time to participate, as applications close on the 19th of February. That’s only a few days away, so don’t take too long to decide! Keep in mind that you need to be at least 18 to take part in the full marathon and at least 17 to take part in the half marathon.

If you’re not really up to the full marathon, you can opt instead to take part in a Half Marathon or a Walkathon (which is technically part of the Half Marathon, but walking participants must remain behind the joggers/runners), which are both happening on the same day.

All three variations of the marathon begin in Mdina, but whereas the full marathon starts at 7.30 am, the other two commence at 9.30 am. If you want to know what the exact difference between the full and half marathons is, the time limit for the former is 5.5 hours, while the half marathon lasts for only 3 hours and 45 minutes. The full marathon amounts to a 42.195km route while the half marathon totals to 21.097km.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1921 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/marathon31.gif" alt="marathon3" width="500" height="282" />

The organisers have chosen to keep the same routes used last year. Funnily enough, regardless of whether you take on the full or half marathon, the route will start in Mdina and end in Sliema, but the full marathon will cover a wider area in between. For more information on the route, you can check out the following link:

In fact, if you need more information in general (including how to participate and what the application fees are), your best bet is to head over to the official site of the marathon:

            [content] => We just wrote an article on the upcoming Vodafone Malta Marathon, which would explain why we’ve got fitness on the brain!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1928" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/workout-1.gif" alt="workout 1.gif" width="425" height="300" />

Joking aside, the Vodafone Malta Marathon is going to provide a great opportunity to exercise for an even greater cause – but that’s a one-time, annual affair that lasts a few hours. If you’re gaining interest in making working out a more permanent part of your lifestyle, you’ll want to check out some of the places in Malta that are most equipped to make you sweat.

The places we’ve chosen for this article all have different price points for different durations of membership, and with many of these options you can even pay for a single visit. This means that you can get started on your fitness routine even if you’re only staying in Malta for a short while. You could be leaving the island tomorrow, and you’d still have time to squeeze in a workout!

We also tried to find places that could offer you a variety of workout options. The most conventional thing to do when looking to get fit is to find a well-equipped gym that has a mixed selection of cardio and weight machines. We’ve certainly packed in quite a few gyms here, but we’ve also got a few alternatives if you’re looking for something a tad different. Although, it’s really essential to keep in mind that nowadays gyms tend to be quite varied, and often offer all sorts of fitness classes.
<strong>24/7 Fitness Club (Mellieha, St Paul’s Bay, San Gwann, Ta’ Qali, Santa Lucia)</strong>

As you might have noted, getting a membership with the 24/7 Fitness Club is a great option for anyone who might be in Malta for a relatively long period of time, or for anyone who happens to travel around the island a lot.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1929" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/workout-2.gif" alt="workout 2.gif" width="500" height="360" />

You can use your membership at all of the five localities they’ve set up at. Apart from localities, you also get access to quite a few facilities, including a gym, free classes, and saunas (where available). The best part, of course, is that it’s true to its name – you can visit any one of these gyms whenever you like, even if you crave a workout at 5am!

<strong>YUE (Naxxar)</strong>

YUE is the place to sign up if you really want a chance to try out everything. Is a regular gym not enough for you? That’s fine – with YUE you can also get personal trainer services, an array of classes (such as yoga and Pilates), and pool facilities that include lap training, hydrotherapy and more. There’s even a gym for kids, and pre and post-natal exercises classes. Need we go on?

We haven’t even touched upon the treatment and consultancy services, with nutrition and physiotherapy being just a few of the services offered.

<strong>Sky Spirit (Luqa)</strong>

Sky Spirit is one of those gym centres that is so comprehensive that you really can’t complain about it at all. This health centre prides itself on a mix of traditional as well as more unique equipment that offers custom workouts to people of all levels of fitness. Since it’s located in Luqa, it’s a wonderful option for anyone who lives closer to the south of Malta. It’s actually quite close to the airport – do you have the stamina to sneak a workout in before your next flight?

<strong>Pilates Centre (St George’s Bay)

</strong>If you want to get healthier without resorting to conventional offerings, Pilates might be for you. A form of exercise that relies on core strength, Pilates is known for significantly reducing back problems and other kinds of physical pain.

The Pilates Centre is located in the Marina hotel at the Corinthia beach resort. You can opt for a number of class layouts, including one-on-one, one-on-two, or group classes with up to eight participants.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1930" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/workout-3.gif" alt="workout 3.gif" width="399" height="224" />

<strong>Zumba with Wesley and Ilona (San Gwann, Gozo)</strong>

If you ever thought that workouts should be more like dance parties, Zumba may be for you. Both hailing from The Netherlands, Wesley and Ilona organise a series of classes (in various locations, although mostly at the San Gwann primary school) that they claim will help you lose weight without any of dread that comes with conventional exercising. A huge plus is that anyone aged 12 onwards is encouraged to take part in the fun!

<strong>Westin Dragonara (St Julian’s)</strong>

If you really want an upper-end solution to get your workout regime in motion, you might want to check out any offerings that a 4 or 5-star resort  might have (you generally won’t have to be staying at the hotel to work out there).

The Westin Dragonara is just one example of a fitness centre that will make sweating feel like a luxury. Here, you’ll get access to a gym, tennis court, sauna, indoor pool, and Jacuzzi. Working out probably never felt this good.

            [content] => This weekend is going to be bursting with Carnival related activities, but with so much noise and bustle in the streets we wouldn’t be surprised if you were looking for an alternative. If you’re set on a slightly different show, we’ve got a suggestion for you – how about you check out a Pro Wrestling match?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1935 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/wrestling2.jpg" alt="wrestling2.jpg" width="960" height="572" />

We’re willing to bet that quite a few people aren’t even aware that Malta has such an active wrestling scene, and this would be understandable since the first event organised by Pro Wrestling Malta only took place in 2015. Since then, the group has been going strong and <em>Hail to the King</em>, taking place on the 25<sup>th</sup> of February at the Montekristo Estates, is just another event in a series of events set to put Malta on the map as a wrestling hub.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1938" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/wrestling3.gif" alt="wrestling3.gif" width="278" height="278" />

Pro Wrestling Malta might be relatively new as an organisation, but that does not mean they’re subpar. If you want proof of this, you only need to check out the following video, which is a montage of clips from a previous wrestling event. It’s easy to get a feel of the Pro Wrestling Malta approach, which to us seems modelled on the more famous TV wrestling programs like WWE and RAW. In other words, you can expect a blend of good old fashioned wrestling with a substantial chunk of that cheesy banter thrown in for good measure. What more could you ask for?

https://www.facebook.com/prowrestlingmalta/videos/1899459463599011/

Don’t expect a cheap soap opera, though. Names like Gianni Valletta and Glamorous Roddy might make you smile, but all of the wrestlers in the Pro Wrestling Malta roster have had plenty of training. Gianni Valletta, for example, spent many years wrestling in the UK. He’s also the main trainer of the Pro Wrestling Malta Academy, located in Zurrieq (If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to wrestle, this is the place to check out).

One of the reasons why Hail to the King is looking to be so exciting is that it will be hosting quite a few international wrestlers from all over the world, including Rob Cage (UK), Red Scorpion (Italy), ‘Sensei of Chops’ Kenzo Richards (Netherlands), ‘The Don’ Francesco Messina (Sicily), and ‘The Super Human’ Lance Lawrence (whose country of origin is currently listed as unknown).

In fact, the main event of the evening is going to be a special match between Gianni Valletta and Red Scorpion. Pro Wrestling Malta are being somewhat secretive about the details of this match, stating only that stipulations of the match are in the hands of Red Scorpion, so there’s a strong mystery element that has us intrigued.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1940" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/wrestling4.gif" alt="wrestling4.gif" width="336" height="199" />
If you need more information about the event, you can check out the Facebook event page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/165204077291066/">https://www.facebook.com/events/165204077291066/</a>) or visit the official Pro Wrestling Malta website (www.pwmalta.com). Tickets can be purchased online and will be slightly cheaper than at the door. Kids under the age of 5 (yes, this is a family event!) go in for free while adults can choose a few ticket options ranging from €12.50 – €20 (online prices) or €15 to €22 (door prices).

            [content] => Heavy metal has never been known as a particularly polite or accessible genre of music. Many misperceive it as a rowdy and violent genre with even rowdier and more violent fans. The reality is quite the opposite, though – heavy metal fans are simply enthralled by the diverse array of sounds that you can find within the genre. Despite the stereotypes, it has a very inclusive, welcoming culture.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1948" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/metal1.gif" alt="metal1.gif" width="330" height="205" />

You might not know it, but Malta has a surprisingly large heavy metal scene, with dozens of active bands and plenty of gigs and annual festivals. Event organisers also tend to invite some of the biggest names in the international metal scene to our tiny island, and the Metal Over Malta Festival, happening on the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> of March, is further proof of this. If you’re a new fan of the genre, a seasoned rocker who remembers the glory days of the 80s, or someone who is simply looking to enrichen his musical palette, Metal Over Malta is unmissable!

Currently in its third edition, the Metal Over Malta festival will be taking place at Chateau Buskett in the outskirts of Rabat. Its secluded feel makes it the perfect venue for such an event! Anyone worried about transport need not worry, as the organisers are providing solutions – but get in touch as soon as you can!

If you don’t recognise any names from the line-up listed on the festival’s Facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/673140919501836/">https://www.facebook.com/events/673140919501836/</a>), the 400+ attendees should definitely indicate that the event is definitely a big deal, considering the usual scale of more underground music concerts in Malta. Headliners Orphaned Land and Civil War are both substantial names in the genre.

Orphaned Land, from Israel, have amassed an incredibly wide following since starting out in 1992, and are famous for playing ‘Oriental Metal’, which is a combination of Middle Eastern musical influences and themes pertaining to Abrahamic religions. As you might have been able to tell, they’re pretty unique:

Civil War are a more recent band, having formed in 2012, but these hard-hitting Swedes quickly found themselves signed to a major label and gained plenty of critical acclaim for their catchy hooks and melodies. This band loves to explore themes of war and history, which means that their appearance in a historically-rich island like Malta is quite apt!

These bands are so well-known that the festival organisers even saw it fit to organise meet-and-greets for both of them! Fans can meet with Civil War on Friday 10<sup>th</sup> March at 9 pm, and Orphaned Land on Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> March at 8 pm.

The rest of line-up is made up of plenty of lesser known (but still great quality) international act and four local bands, namely Animamortua, Weeping Silence, Abysmal Torment and Forsaken. Though Animamortua is a newer (but still formidable) band, the other three names are respected as big names locally as well as on the international circuit. Indeed, all three bands have played at numerous festivals abroad throughout their long histories (Forsaken celebrated its 25-year anniversary just last November).

Weeping Silence is also the band responsible for organising the Metal Over Malta festival year after year, making them excellent curators in addition to great musicians!

You can find specific information about the running order here:

Ticket prices at the door for the festival run at 40 euro for both days, or 20 euro for Friday/30 euro for Saturday. That might seem slightly pricey if you’re a more casual music fan, but considering the impressive headliners, overall quality of the acts, and guaranteed excellent of the festival in general, we can promise that the price is well worth it.

            [content] => Ladies and gentlemen, the future is now. Or rather, the future is later this month. If you’re a technology-nut, it’s imperative that you get down to the MFCC (Malta Fairs and Conventions Centre) on the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> of March for the Malta Robotics Olympiad 2017!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1954" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/robots3.gif" alt="robots3.gif" width="500" height="282" />

The Malta Robotics Olympiad is a free annual event, now in its sixth year, organised by the Ministry for Education an Employment in partnership with GO. Though the event is mostly aimed at student participation and is set to make younger audiences interested in technology, the event can be enjoyed by anyone who has even the slightest fascination with gizmos and gadgets! From competitions to workshops, there’s something to appeal to every single age group.

If you’re already figuring out how to pencil the dates in your calendar, don’t worry too much because the event will be open to the public for most of the weekend. On Friday 24<sup>th</sup> the event begins at 4 pm and lasts till 10.30 pm, while the next day you can go as early as 9 am, with the closing time also being 10.30 pm. Here are some of the best parts of the event to look forward to during MRO17!

The main competition during the whole competition is a Lego Sumo Competition, which is only open to Middle and Secondary School students in Forms 1-5. You can still watch the action take place if you like! This year, the competition is particularly exciting because it doubles as national qualifiers. The winning team will represent Malta in an International Lego Sumo Challenge!

For something that is bound to be a little bit more exciting to older audiences, the event to watch is the MRO Big Challenge, which is aimed at students who like a bit more intensity in their competitions. In this particular challenge, participants need to build a robot that is programmed to autonomously go through an obstacle course!

https://www.facebook.com/go.com.mt/videos/1380624998625279/

Part of MRO17 is also the Malta Drone Nationals, which is the first European Drone Racing Championship qualifier of this year’s drone racing season. This particular event will be laid out over both days of MRO17 and is looking to be one of the most exciting parts of the weekend. The Malta Drone Nationals are divided into different competition segments, including a racetrack full of stunt modules and a freestyle competition!

One of the more interactive parts of MRO17 is a Design and Technology Expo that invites the public to test out the products and inventions brought to the table by participating students. In 2016 over 400 projects were on display. If the numbers this year are similar, anyone into gadgets will see this segment of MRO as a Christmas village of sorts! Speaking of interactivity, the MRO Esports Arena, which is taking the form of a full-scale gaming tournament called Overwatch, will go down a treat for people with a knack for getting the best of games.

One segment of MRO17 that we’re really excited about is the series of EDx conferences that will be taking place. Speakers include prestigious lecturers from the University of Malta as well as a live session with CERN, from the Large Hadron Collider area!

On display this year will also be a full-scale and functioning Wall-E robot, which is bound to be a hit for anyone who’s watched the impeccable Disney Pixar film. This will be the second year that the MRO team has taken up the challenge of building a pop culture robot, as last year they successfully replicated the BB-8 Droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

All in all, if you want to whirr your wonder and electrify your excitement, MRO17 is hands down the place to be on the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> of March! For more information, visit <a href="https://mromalta.com/">https://mromalta.com/</a>.

            [content] => Located in the North East part of Malta, Buġibba is definitely known for its charm. It’s one of those areas that saw rapid development in the 1960s, and quickly became a major attraction in the islands.

That being said, we feel like this particular village isn’t always given its due attention. It’s easy to overlook Buġibba, with so many other wonderful spots in Malta, but Buġibba isn’t a discount Paceville or Sliema. Rather, we’ll happily argue that Buġibba is one of the loveliest and most versatile places in Malta. Don’t take our word for it, though. Here’s a list of all the activities you can pack in a trip to Buġibba (actually, scratch that – you might need five or six separate trips to squeeze everything in!).

Don't blame us if you fall in love with this quaint town! Well, if you really can't help it, why not stay here on your trip to Malta? Check out some great accommodation options <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/Delfin_Court_2-Bedroom_Apt" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/085_Delfin_Penthouse_with_Views" target="_blank">here</a>.

N.B.: Because these villages are so connected, this article will also include attractions from the Qawra, Salina, and St. Paul’s Bay areas.

<strong> </strong>
<strong>Hang out at the village square</strong>

The Buġibba square is an iconic part of the village. Though small, it’s an excellent place to sit down, unwind, and have a chat while soaking in the sea-salty air. The square also surrounds lots of neighbouring cafes and restaurants that you can visit when you get thirsty or peckish.

<strong>Go scuba diving</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1963" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba1.gif" alt="bugibba1.gif" width="457" height="270" />

Buġibba is essentially a seaside village, and that’s not something that you can easily ignore considering that the wonderful sea breeze will follow you everywhere you turn. If you want to take your experience with the sea a step further, though, you might want to visit one of the many scuba diving centres you can find around the village!



<strong>Grab a bite to eat</strong>

From fish and chips, to meaty burgers, to classic pub food, to Indian cuisine, and more, you can really find it all at Buġibba. It’s very hard to scout the village for a proper bite to eat and not find the right eatery for you. Once you’ve filled your stomach with savoury goodness, a Buġibba dessert is a must – we recommend getting an ice cream from one of the many exquisite gelaterias in the area.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1964" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba2.gif" alt="bugibba2.gif" width="500" height="281" />

<strong>Walk along the seafront
</strong>
This one is pretty self-explanatory – we’ve already raved about the Buġibba sea about three times in this article, but you won’t understand how serene it really is unless you visit it first-hand. If the weather’s good enough (and considering that spring it just around the corner it should be) you can even walk down to one of the rocky beach areas and relax there – or even take a quick swim if you’re so inclined.



<strong>Look for megalithic ruins</strong>

This is a Buġibba secret of sorts, but the Dolmen hotel in the Qawra area is actually built around ancient megalithic findings. The placement is a little awkward, but it sure makes for an intriguing few minutes of your time.

<strong>Visit the Classic Car Museum</strong>

If you’re still in the Qawra area, the Classic Car museum is a must for vehicle enthusiasts. The collection here spans over 50 years and includes Austins, Jaguars, Triumps, Ferraris, and more.
<strong>Visit the Bird Park</strong>

Everyone loves birds! The Bird Park in Salina is great for kids and adults alike, and will make any animal-lover’s heart melt. Apart from the vast array of birds, you’ll also find some other kinds of animals here.
<strong>
Visit the Malta National Aquarium
</strong>
The Aquarium is arguably a little farther away from Buġibba but is still close enough in the area to pay a visit so long as you’re on an animal-viewing tour. The impressive collection here includes all varieties of fish, amphibians and even reptiles!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1966" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba3.gif" alt="bugibba3.gif" width="480" height="210" />
<strong>
Watch a film</strong>

The Empire cinema in Buġibba means that a great family-friendly option is always available!

<strong>Enjoy the Nightlife
</strong>
On the other hand, you’ll want to leave the kids at home if you decide to spend your weekend night out in Bugibba. There are plenty of bars, pubs, clubs, and even karaoke bars to choose from. If you want to party without the huge crowds you’ll get at Paceville and similar areas, Buġibba is definitely your best bet.

<strong>Go gambling
</strong>
That’s right, Buġibba has a few options if you enjoy wagering money to win money. The biggest hit by far here is the Oracle casino, which is the place to be if you want a huge choice of slot games, blackjack, poker, roulette, baccarat, and so on.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1968" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba4.gif" alt="bugibba4.gif" width="500" height="283" />

Another option is to check out the Fairplay Bingo Hall, which is the largest Bingo Hall in Malta. With a total of 55 tables, this is the best to be for a communitarian gambling experience.

            [content] => If you’re staying or living in Malta right now, you will have heard that the great Michael McIntyre is giving a show in Malta on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of April. If so, you’re either one of the lucky ones who managed to snag a ticket before they sold out in 90 minutes, or you might be one of the hundreds of disappointed people who simply weren’t fast enough.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1980" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/standup1.gif" alt="standup1.gif" width="540" height="304" />

The demand for McIntyre was so great that a second show is now scheduled for the 21<sup>st</sup> of April, a day before the original show. The tickets for that date are now sold out too – so if you want to catch McIntyre live in action you’re either going to have to travel abroad, wait for the next one, or find someone selling his ticket (probably at a pretty ghastly upcharge).

Whether you’re watching McIntyre live in Malta or not, the excitement of the whole thing might have made you curious about Malta’s stand-up comedy culture. Is Malta the place to be if you want to have your sides split, or is the island infested by comedy try-hards?

We’re happy to report that the comedy scene in Malta is pretty good – and beyond this, it’s growing every year. This is true both in terms of local performers as well as international guests. In fact, Michael McIntyre coming to Malta is not a miraculous affair or one-off incident. 2016 alone saw the comedy giants Jimmy Carr and Omid Djalili coming to Malta, too. We also have a fair share of local comedians who might not be world famous, but can definitely hold their own alongside some bigger names.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1982" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/standup2.gif" alt="standup2.gif" width="500" height="282" />

If you want to follow the comedy scene in Malta, you’re best off by following some of the bigger comedy production groups that are responsible for organising stand-up nights with some of Malta’s best as well as the standout names on the international circuit. You can learn about some of these below, so you won’t miss the next chance to chuckle.

Do keep in mind that there are also plenty of comedy groups that perform in Maltese, but we won’t go into those today – this article is mostly intended for audiences who want to get their fix of comedy delivered in English.

<strong>The Comedy Knights</strong>

The Comedy Knights definitely has one of the strongest rosters of local comedians, so their events should definitely be a first point of reference if you’re interested in learning how the Maltese do comedy.

The Comedy Knights usually organise large-scale events, with a series of skits and characters to watch out for, so if you attend one of their shows you might not be in for a stand-up routine in the proper sense of the word. You’ll also definitely need to update yourself on Maltese culture, as common topics include Maltese politics and Maltese caricatures (such as stereotypical girls from Sliema).

You can also keep an eye out for any other comedy projects by any of the Comedy Knights team members, including Chris Dingli, Jo Caruana, Pia Zammit, Colin Fitz, Steve Hili, and several more.



<strong>The Eden Comedy Club</strong>

The Eden Cinema building is not just for watching films! Its multipurpose theatre makes for a great stand-up comedy venue, and the frequent events that are hosted there are always proof of this.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/standup3.gif" alt="standup3.gif" width="400" height="300" />

There are a couple of reasons why the Eden events are worth looking out for. The first is that they’re frequently held, which means that if you’re craving some comedy you probably won’t have too long to wait if you follow the Eden programme. The second is that the Eden Comedy Club usually brings a pretty eclectic mix of local and international talent. Their last event, for example, was held on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of March of this year, and featured Matt Welcome, Danny Posthill, and was hosted by Geoff Whiting.

<strong>Laugh Out Loud Productions</strong>

The LOL acronym might be a little obvious for a comedy agency group, but you do need to keep in mind that this agency has been around for ages, having started in 2004. To say that Laugh Out Loud know what they’re doing would be an understatement.

Laugh Out Loud specialising in bringing some of the top names in the UK comedy scene to Malta. Some names that have made their way to our shores thanks to this group include Men in Coats, JoJo Smith, Andrew Maxwell, Terry Anderton, Andre Vincent, and many more!

            [content] => In this age of political correctness, some people might think that celebrating St Patrick’s Day in Malta is more or less cultural appropriation. It’s not a Maltese tradition by any stretch of the imagination – so why do we hit the pubs year after year?

There’s no easy way to answer this question. Well, actually that’s not quite true – the simple answer is that in Malta, just like in most countries, it’s just another excuse to down a pint. Celebrating this Irish day provides an opportunity to drink with friends, and we’ll happily take it!

On the other hand, it does lead one to wonder how many of the holidays and traditions that are now universal, or at least central to Western society, originated from one specific country or part of the world and expanded exponentially (don’t worry, folks, this is as philosophical an article on drinking is going to get from our end). So there’s that!

That being said, we’re well aware that St Patrick’s is always going to be an Irish tradition, and the Maltese definitely don’t mean to belittle anybody’s culture by joining in the festivities.  Still, a pint is a pint.

Plus (and this is a big plus), Malta has an abundance of really authentic Irish Pubs (many of them owned by people who are, you know, Irish). Considering our connection with the UK, it’s not really surprising that there’s no shortage of British bars, but this article will specifically be looking at a few of the top Irish bars in Malta to visit this Saint Patrick’s Day. Before you eagerly wear your favourite green clothes and head out on March 17<sup>th</sup>, do keep in mind that if you want to get a good spot at any of these bars, you’re going to have to think ahead!

<strong>
The Dubliner, St. Julian’s</strong>

The Dubliner is easily one of the more popular Irish pubs in Malta, and it’s easy to see why. The pub was launched in 2004, when there was a relative lack of Irish bars on the island. It would be unfair to say that The Dubliner has only made it because it was one of the first on the scene, though. This pub has the whole package, from décor, to its selection of drinks, and of course its incredible Irish pub food menu.

<strong>Ryan’s Irish Pub, St. Julian’s</strong>

Though technically an Irish Pub, Ryan’s is usually associated with crowds of partying youngsters. If you feel like getting wild this St Patrick’s day, Ryan’s is definitely the place to consider!

<strong>Cork's Irish Pub, St. Julian’s </strong>

‘How many Irish Pubs are there in St. Julian’s?’, you must be wondering. The answer is ‘plenty’.

‘Don’t they get boring?’, we hear you follow-up. The answer is ‘nope’.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/irish3.gif" alt="irish3.gif" width="480" height="270" />

Cork’s isn’t just another Irish Pub, though. Its patrons love it particularly for its frequent live music, so be on the hunt for that on the 17<sup>th</sup> of March!

<strong>The Drayton's Pub, St Julians</strong>

What’s better than an Irish Pub? How about an Irish Pub with a Billiard table?

That’s really most of what can be said about Drayton’s Pub in a nutshell, though it definitely is a fun place to be. Drink Guinness. Play pool. Go crazy.

<strong>O'Reilly's Irish Pub, Bugibba</strong>

If you want more of a sit down experience with great food to boot, but want to avoid the whole St Julian’s area, one great option is O’Reilly’s in Bugibba. Their generous portions mean that there’s no way you can scoff down their food and remain unsatisfied.

Plus, if you’re not really in the mood for beer (which is somewhat sacrilegious considering the date), you could always opt for one of their many cocktail options.

            [content] => How the mighty have fallen, as they say! The Azure Window had been a national treasure for years – so it’s no wonder that its collapse has led to such dismay.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1999 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural2.jpg" alt="natural2" width="960" height="640" />

If you’ve been living under a rock (we apologise for the pun, but it was inevitable), the Azure Window, known also as the Dwejra Window, was a natural limestone arch in Gozo, located in Dwejra Bay. It was a massive tourist attraction for numerous reasons. Apart from its natural splendour, it was also featured in numerous films and TV series, such as Clash of the Titans, The Count of Monte Cristo, Game of Thrones, The Odyssey, and more. The aura surrounding the Azure Window was definitely not overhyped.

Its collapse is definitely a sad story because everyone was expecting it – just not so soon. Parts of the top slab began to collapse between the 1980s and the 2000s, with initial sign of collapsing in 2012. Geologists who studied the arch noted that the Window would be stable for a number of years, but that its stability would be compromised if people kept getting too close. Unfortunately, they did – up until the past few days before the storm led to its collapse this March.

Sad as it is, though, there’s not much do be done about the whole thing now, though discussions regarding possible solutions and actions have already started taking place. We reckon that the best thing to do now is to invest in other existing sites in order to safeguard them better as well as promote them to people who might be as aware of them.

Indeed, the archipelago is still chockful of gorgeous natural attractions. This article will delve into a few of them so that it will be a long while before you run out of expeditions in Malta and Gozo!

<strong>The Blue Gotto</strong>

<strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2001" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural3.jpg" alt="natural3.jpg" width="718" height="539" />
</strong><strong>
</strong>Located near ‘Wied iz-Zurreq’, south of Qrendi, The Blue Grotto is the largest cave out of a group of caves in the same area. You can only reach The Blue Grotto by boat, and it definitely makes for a serene experience. Filfa is also visible from this area!

<strong>Calypso’s Cave</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2003 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural4.jpg" alt="natural4.jpg" width="576" height="396" />

This is another popular cave, but this time you’ll have to go to Gozo (specifically Xaghra) to visit, making it an even better candidate to fill the void left by the Azure Window collapse. If you’re savvy about classical literature at all, you probably don’t need us to tell you what’s special about this cave: people believe that this is the cave referred to by Homer in the iconic ‘The Odyssey’!

<strong>Ninu’s Cave</strong>
<strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2004" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural5.jpg" alt="natural5.jpg" width="587" height="405" />
</strong><em>Photo credit: www.maltaholidays.uk.com</em>
Also located in Xaghra, this cave is known for two main things – its stalagmite and stalactite formations, and even more impressive than this are the amazing views you can witness from inside the cave!

<strong>Fungus Rock</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2009" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fungus-rock.jpg" alt="Fungus Rock.jpg" width="1024" height="768" />



If you need to get even closer to the Azure Window site, you can opt to visit Fungus Rock, which is located in Dwejra too. Also known as General’s Rock, this wonder takes the form of a small islet that is 60 metres high. In the time of the Order of St. John, it was believed that a type of tuber that grows on Fungus Rock had medicinal properties. As a result, only authorised knights were legally allowed to climb it!

<strong>The Inland Sea</strong>

<strong><img class=" size-full wp-image-2007 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural7.jpg" alt="natural7.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

</strong>For more Dwejra goodness, check out the Inland Sea, which a saltwater lagoon that connects to the Mediterranean Sea by way of a natural tunnel arch. The tunnel is wide enough that <em>luzzijiet</em> can pass through it on calm days!

            [content] => There’s no shortage of cultural activity in Malta. It doesn’t matter how many times we say it – it just never stops being true. Sometimes, there are so many events happening on a single day that it’s absolutely impossible to select a single one. This year, the 25<sup>th</sup> of March is definitely one of those days, which is why we’ve written this article to provide a comprehensive overview of all the artsy happenings that day.

So much for that lazy Saturday! How many of these activities are you going to try and squeeze in?
<strong>Evita</strong>

In Maltese, ‘Evita’ is the imperative word for ‘avoid’, but in this case we’re referring to the classic musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice! Happening at the Astra Theatre, this will actually be the first performance of Evita in Gozo.

Whether you’re new to theatre or have a deep-rooted passion for it, there’s really no reason why watching this Grammy-winning classic is a bad idea – even if it’s just to belt out ‘Don’t Cry for Me, Argentina!’

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2014" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/arts2.gif" alt="arts2.gif" width="260" height="144" />



<strong>Gospel Music Concert - Two Choirs</strong>

Looking for a unique musical experience? How about a collaboration between an Irish Gospel Choir and a Maltese one?

The Lucan Gospel Choir from Dublin will be coming to Malta after 10 years, having first visited in 2007. They will be pairing up with Joy Gospel Singers from Malta to deliver a fantastic aural spectacle. This event is happening for free at the St Lawrence Church in Birgu and is supported by the Irish Embassy in Malta.
<strong>Roger’s Floyd in Malta</strong>

If Gospel music isn’t quite your thing, there’s a chance that rock music might be. Specifically, rock music from one of the greatest bands in the world – Pink Floyd.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2015" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/arts3.gif" alt="arts3.gif" width="474" height="356" />

All things considered, watching Pink Floyd live is a bit of an improbability, though, and much less in Malta. Thanks to high quality tribute bands, though, the spirit of Pink Floyd lives on, and Roger’s Floyd is giving you the opportunity to partake in that spirit at the Orpheum Theatre in Gzira. This is no small deal – Roger’s Floyd is one of the top Pink Floyd Tribute bands in the UK. Are you getting comfortably numb with excitement?
<strong>Colours in Motion</strong>

A project inspired by Malta’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, Colours in Motion is an architectural projection piece that will be showcased at the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta. The projections follow the narrative of a young girl exploring the three major themes of Malta’s EU presidency, including migration, maritime and Mediterranean. The setting of the world portrayed in the projections is inspired by iconic European paintings.

Specifically, though, the Colours in Motion project is a celebration of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which led to the eventual creation of the European Union.

An original score, written by Reuben Zahra, has been written to accompany the project.

<strong>Annual Scale Model Exhibition</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2017" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/arts4.gif" alt="arts4.gif" width="480" height="366" />

This one is definitely more niche-oriented than the other events, but we’re sure it’s bound to appeal to some people nonetheless. If you’re into scale models portraying era-specific vehicles and other items, then this is definitely the event for you. Taking place at the Catholic Insitute in Floriana, the Annual Scale Model Exhibition is a great way to relax and focus on the finer details…of scale models.

            [content] => The Maltese sure know how to pack a lot of architecture into one small archipelago. You’ll have noticed this with how there seems to be churches everywhere. However, the same is true of our theatres. We have a very vibrant theatre culture in Malta, with no shortage of performances of international and local productions. It’s only fitting that there would be ample spaces that accommodate this continuous drive towards the Arts. What’s more is that theatres here are often used for multiple purposes.

Although the question here really needs to our take on an old cliché: what came first, the theatres, or the theatre culture? It’s a little bit more complicated than that – but maybe you can come with your own answer as you go through this list of some of the most popular and gorgeous theatres in Malta.

<strong>The Manoel Theatre, Valletta</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2025 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre2.jpg" alt="theatre2" width="649" height="347" />

An obligatory mention, the Manoel Theatre in Valletta is Malta’s national theatre, and the oldest functioning theatre in all of Europe. This theatre was built in 1731 by Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena, as a way of creating a proper space for shows and what he called ‘honest entertainment’. Before this, they were housed at the Knight’s Auberges, or in public spaces.

<strong>Astra Theatre, Victoria</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2033 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/opera.jpg" alt="Opera" width="1200" height="766" />
One of the main theatres in Victoria, this Gozitan theatre is mostly known for its extensive display of opera and musicals, but is by no means limited to just these genres. Since its inception in 1968, the Astra Theatre has hosted world-class singers such as Pamela Kucenic, Adeilaide Negri, Giuseppe Giacomini, and of course Malta’s own Joseph Calleja.
<strong>St James Cavalier, Valletta</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2026" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre4.jpg" alt="theatre4.jpg" width="492" height="290" />

Not so much a sole theatre so much as it is a ‘centre for creativity’, St James Cavalier is one of Malta’s top spaces for any kind of event from theatre productions, art exhibitions, music concerts, workshops, film showings, and more. The best news is that there’s always a packed calendar full of exciting events to appeal to any culture enthusiast.
<strong>The MITP Theatre, Valletta</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2027" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre5.jpg" alt="theatre5.jpg" width="864" height="576" />
Photo credit: www.hairyampmalta.com
This is considerably more contemporary theatre, in the sense that the MITP theatre is a ‘black box’ venue of sorts that is malleable in its function and has been used for theatre as well as music concerts and dance events. The MITP Theatre is located at the Old University Campus, so it’s not surprising that you’ll find everything here from the provocative to the sophisticated.

<strong>Masquerade/M Space, Imsida</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2028" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre6.jpg" alt="theatre6.jpg" width="320" height="320" />

Masquerade is an educational space as much as it is a performative one. With plenty of arts education programmes (ranging from theatre, dance and music), you might find yourself reaching out to Masquerade should you ever want to participate in the arts more directly.

Masquerade has been active since 1997, but in 2012 a new 7-storey building – M Space – was launched, in order to provide even better facilities and even more interesting performing spaces.

<strong>The Salesian Theatre, Sliema</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2029" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre7.jpg" alt="theatre7.jpg" width="2074" height="1382" />

The Salesian Theatre in Sliema has been in operation since 1908, and has long since been established as a prime theatre outlet in Malta. The team behind the theatre often invite performers to the stage, and also organise productions within its Salesian community, which is a Christian life community that seeks to inspire youth with artistic creation as a constant drive.

<strong>Royal Opera House, Valletta</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2030" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre8.jpg" alt="theatre8.jpg" width="500" height="480" />

The Royal Opera House in Valletta is a particularly special theatre because it was built on the ruins of the former Opera House, which was ruined in World War II. Only inaugurated in 2013, this open air theatre is now one of the most gorgeous spaces you can hope to see a production at, especially during warmer months. The Royal Opera House has hosted everything from music festivals, to King Lear productions, and all else in between.

<strong>The Mediterranean Conference Centre, Valletta</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2031" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre9.jpg" alt="theatre9.jpg" width="377" height="272" />

The building in the Valletta that is now the MCC began life all the way back in 1574 as a ward during the time of the Order of the Knights of St. John. After literally centuries of changing uses and refurbishments, the MCC found a new voice as a multipurpose building that is used for theatrical events, concerts, exhibitions, conferences (of course) and so much more.

            [content] => It’s that time of the year when the Passion is back in fashion. For Catholics in Malta and around the world, it’s a time of remembrance, solitude, contemplation, and ultimately celebration. However, it’s also a time in which devotees can show tribute to the biblical event by participating in plays and pageants.

This year, just like every other year, Malta is the place to be if you want to experience productions relating to the Easter story, and you’re bound to find a production that suits your interests whether you’re looking for a faithful retelling, or an interpretation.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2059 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/easter-4.jpg" alt="easter 4.jpg" width="1020" height="714" />

This article will provide a comprehensive overview of many of the Easter productions happening in Malta this year.

<strong>Jesus Christ Superstar
</strong>A now classic and a unanimous favourite, it’s hard to not get excited over a performance of <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>. Taking place at the Catholic Institute in Floriana on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> of April, this rendition of the Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice work features some top names in Malta as well as a live, 12-piece orchestra.

<strong>Live Last Supper</strong>

Happening in Mqabba, in the Subterranean Camber of Palazz Santa Marija in the church square, between the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> of April (though not every day) this last supper is set to provide an interesting take on Judas’ role in the whole story, with the pivotal question asked being whether Judas was a traitor, or in fact betrayed himself.

<strong>Iesus</strong>

The Senglea drama group is known for putting on spectacular dramas on an annual basis during Holy Week. This year is no exception as their new play, Iesus, will be performed at Sede Azzjoni Kattolika in Senglea on the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> of April.

<strong>Rajt.Smajt.Qtilt</strong>

Rajt.Smajt.Qtilt (I saw.I heard.I killed) might be an odd choice of name for an Easter show, much more so for one that is happening in Birzebbuga’s Primary School Hall. However, it’s definitely a guarantee that this will be one of the more intriguing takes on the Passion story. In fact, Rajt.Smajt.Qtilt is apparently a more modern interpretation overall. Unfortunately, we doubt that people who don’t know Maltese will be able to follow.
<strong>Calix Amaritudinis</strong>

This is another production that is set to add a fresh look on the story of Jesus Christ. Calix Amaritudinis focuses specifically on an abduction plot crafted by the priests in an attempt to thwart Christ. Judas is, of course, a key character here. The fact that a World War II shelter in Qormi is being readapted for this play is a cool plus!<strong>
</strong>
<strong>Handel’s Messiah</strong>

Although this is not a play, we have to mention this performance by the Goldberg Ensemble of Handel’s timeless classic, The Messiah. Happening at St Paul’s Anglican Pro-Cathedral in Valletta on the 16<sup>th</sup> of April, you can expect a rather faithful interpretation of the work as Handel himself intended, with single strings and few singers.

<strong>Jesus Christ Superstar Shelter Show</strong>

4Teenth Productions will produce for the third and last time highlights from the musical ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’; a rock opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. This musical depicts the last few hours of Jesus Christ as seen through the eyes of Judas Iscariot. This year the production will be totally different to what was presented in the past two years. The show will include different musical tracks and an innovative take on stage direction. Jesus Christ Superstar Shelter Show will be held on the 12th amp; 13th April (shows starting at 8pm, 9pm, 10pm and 11pm) and on Friday 14<sup>th</sup> April (shows starting at 9am, 10am, 11am and noon).

            [content] => With the first of April just around the corner, it’s time for something a little bit more light-hearted on our end. We wouldn’t say that Malta has a very strong April Fool’s culture here, although if you’ve been here enough you’ll know that the Maltese have a very specific brand of humour that’s witty and generally somewhat naughty. You’ll also know we’re always up for a good laugh and don’t need any reason to whip out the metaphorical joke book, so pranks do often go down a treat here, too.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2090" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-6.gif" alt="prank 6.gif" width="500" height="500" />

Whether you’re Maltese-born and raised, or if this is your first time on the island, you might be looking for a few Malta-specific pranks to play on your friends, family, or loved ones. That’s where we come in, as we’ve thought of a few simple practical jokes that we reckon should work pretty well. Don’t share this article before you’ve tested a few out, or your victims will catch on!

<strong>The Nasty Pastizzi Prank</strong>

There’s only one thing that’s better than a pastizz, and that’s a free pastizz. That means that if you offer a pastizz to anyone, it’s almost impossible to find someone who will refuse. Even the initial hesitations of ‘<em>le ta</em><strong>, </strong>I’m on a diet’ can be thwarted by the irresistible fumes of flaky goodness.

The premise of this prank is simple – buy (or make) a few ricotta pastizzi…and hide a large glob of toothpaste in the filling. The first few bites of heaven will quickly lead into a something a lot more hellish. <strong>
</strong>
<strong>The Weather Prank</strong>

If you’ve lived in Malta for longer than five minutes, you probably know how temperamental Malta’s weather is. The only constant seems to be in summer, when the weather ranges from ‘hot’ to ‘unbearably scorching’. Every other season is a bit of a moody mess, and since April Fool’s happens in Spring, you have the opportunity to use the weather to your advantage for a few laughs.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2091" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-7.gif" alt="prank 7.gif" width="800" height="600" />

This one is super simple – all you need to do is tell a friend (who won’t have gotten out of bed yet) what the weather is like that day, but of course you’d be describing the exact opposite of what the weather will actually be like. Your friend will likely dress up for the day all wrong, and have to change his outfit again before he really leaves the house.

<strong>The ‘It’s a Public Holiday’ Prank</strong>

That Malta has an overabundance of public holidays is a well-known fact. We have so many public holidays that we can barely keep up with them all, but nobody who’s even slightly hedonistic is going to pass up the chance to take it easy all day.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2069" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-4.gif" alt="prank 4.gif" width="300" height="167" />

That means you might manage to convince someone – Maltese or not – that the 1<sup>st</sup> of April is actually a public holiday. Make up a saint or fake World War II period celebration – it’s your call.

This year, April Fool’s is happening on a Saturday. This makes your job somewhat easier because most people won’t be working anyway. On the downside, you probably won’t be convincing anyone that they don’t need to go to work, but you might be able to rouse some patriotic sentiments that you can poke fun at later when you explain that there is no such public holiday.

<strong>The –Insert Monument Here- Has Collapsed Prank</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-5.gif" alt="prank 5.gif" width="250" height="266" />

This one is probably a little mean-spirited considering that people are still feeling the loss of the Azure Window, but that’s all the more reason for it to work. Pick one of Malta’s monuments. It can be a natural monument (we have a whole article on these), or even one of Malta’s megalithic temples (we have an article on these, too!) and convince a friend that it’s collapsed, you’ll be an April Fool’s King. Don’t let anyone mourn for too long, though!
<strong>The ‘I’m Staying in Malta Forever’ Prank</strong>

If you’re only meant to be living in Malta for a few days, weeks, or months, you can always give your family a scare by telling them you love it so much here that you’re going to stay here forever. You can make the story even more elaborate by mentioning that you’ve met the love of your life, or that you think the living conditions are too good to get away from.

We reckon it would be very easy for this prank to succeed, too. After all, who wouldn’t want to live in Malta forever?

            [content] => Festival names are a curious affair. Some festivals have almost entirely cryptic names that delight the imagination, and could leave you guessing what the nature of the event is for hours unless you simply decide to look up more information. The Craft Beer amp; Live Music Festival is not one of those festivals.

That’s not to say it’s going to be a bland festival, because it clearly is not. Happening between the 7<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> of April, in what was once one of the most notorious areas in Valletta’s history, the Gut (has the meaning been re-appropriated to represent the Beer Gut?), the festival is the perfect combination of the elements that make a great night out.

Still not convinced that the Craft Beer amp; Live Music Festival isn’t worth your time? Allow us to try and get you on board in this article.

<strong>The Craft Beer</strong>

As far as beer in Malta is concerned, Cisk is the main religion. This is indisputable. There’s not a single person alive in Malta who is not aware of this iconic beverage. Yet, although Cisk will always be a staple part of the Maltese diet, craft beers are all the rage lately. You don’t even need to be a moustache twirling hipster to partake in the hype.



<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/craft-4.gif" alt="craft 4.gif" width="422" height="238" />



Although somewhat pricey, the taste of a good craft beer in unmatchable and there’s so much variety that it’s impossible to not find something that suits your taste buds perfectly.
In Malta, passion for craft beers has been brewing for quite a few years, and now we have a few companies such as Stretta and Lord Chambray that put out refined beers for refined gentlemen (or anyone into beer, really).


<img class=" size-full wp-image-2078 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/craft-2.jpg" alt="craft 2" width="960" height="509" /><em>Photo credit: Stretta Craft Beer</em>
The craft beer part of this festival is organised by Stretta, which is a really new brewery, having only launched last year. In fact, it only has one craft beer currently out, although a few other types are in the works. The current Stretta beer is an India Pale Ale which is slightly fruity but not to the detriment of the distinct, malty taste. It’s a delight, and packs quite the punch on the alcohol side of things, too.

We recommend that everyone gives Stretta a try at the festival, but that’s not the only craft beer on offer. Indeed, there will be over 30 types from breweries all around the world.

<strong>The Live Music</strong>

<strong>

</strong>
The other part of the festival, i.e. the location handling and music, is being handled by Offbeat, which is a music bar entity opening later this year. Offbeat is already proving itself as a force to be reckoned with by selecting some of the most exciting acts right now, such as KażinSka, a group that plays ska versions of band marches; Swing Nuages, which is probably the finest band playing gypsy jazz in Malta; and YEWS, who is one of the most dynamic and unique solo artists on the island. Of course, we can’t not mention the equally great Tony Camilleri, Nadine Axisa, and Hot Club of Valletta.

<strong> </strong><strong>The Location</strong>

The festival is taking place at the McKay Bar in the Strada Stretta area, and any history nut will know that this is actually kind of historical. Also known as the Silver Horse, the McKay bar hasn’t been open in 50 years. As a Strada Stretta bar, it was one of the main hotspots for English sailors back in the day, meaning that it was the site of much rowdiness and debauchery. Cabaret shows, transvestitism (back then a big deal), and all sorts of similar acts could be found at the Silver Horse. You probably won’t find much of the same during the festival, though.

            [content] => Horses are a very big part of Maltese culture. Sometimes our relationship with horses meets a few raised eyebrows by the international community, especially since Malta is one of the countries that finds eating horse meat acceptable (but this is not the space for that ethical debate).

Ultimately, the truth is that the Maltese love their fellow neigh-bours (we take no responsibility for any groaning incurred through this pun). If you want to get in on the horse-love, horse riding is an excellent place to start, and it’s a pretty common activity in Malta that is enjoyed by kids and adults alike.

Why opt for horse riding, though? Isn’t it better to simply admire horses without climbing on top of them and having them trot with your added weight?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2102 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/horse-4.gif" alt="horse 4" width="450" height="253" />

The truth is that horse riding is an activity that, when done right, can benefit both the horse and the rider. Think about our relationship with dogs – a relationship built across millennia that makes our canine connection special. Our relationship with horses is very similar, in the sense that humans have ridden horses since the two species existed in the same evolutionary period. When horses are treated with kindness, riding them can make for a very connected experience.

Don’t take our word for it, though. Experts have provided much insight as to how and why horse riding can be beneficial to both the horse and the person riding it. On a personal level, horse riding promotes skills that involve coordination, balance, timing and rhythm. It also provides mental and physical relaxation and so works as a means of de-stressing while also boosting your physical abilities.

The same benefits are observable in the horses, so while you might feel that riding beloved equestrians might be oppressive, the truth is that when done right they will become happier mentally and physically.

The question, of course, now is where to get your horse riding fix in Malta. We’ll happily direct you to Golden Bay Horse Riding, a horse riding service provider in the Mellieha area that been active since 1981. With 32 years of experience you can bet that Golden Bay Horse Riding is fully equipped to help you trot with ease. Indeed, the company has come a long way since its first year, when siblings Beverley and Mario Frendo only had a 4-horse stable.

Golden Bay Horse Riding take great pride in the care of their horses. They’re not kept in the sun, and never let them carry a weight that exceeds 95 kilos.

There are lots of options at Golden Bay Horse Riding, including hour long rides as well as sunset rides – and all of this is offered at very reasonable prices. You don’t even need to leave the kids behind, as anyone aged 5 onwards is welcome to participate. Do note, though, that booking has to be made 2 days prior to the ride. This gives you plenty of opportunity to plan out the rest of the day – you can go for a swim at the Golden Bay beach after, or grab a drink from one of the numerous nearby cafés.

            [content] => If you’ve been following our blog for a while, you’ll know that there’s no shortage of places to work out at in Malta if you’re into gyms. Yet the fitness possibilities in Malta don’t end there. From weights, to all kinds of sports, to martial arts and more, you can rest assured that you’ll find the right place for you to break a sweat in.

If you’re into yoga, the same is also true. For the uninitiated, yoga is an excellent practice to introduce to your daily routine. More than simply exercise, yoga is an excellent way of regulating your breathing, strengthening your core, and also focusing yourself mentally through meditation. It really is an all-in-one package.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2110" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/sup-4.gif" alt="sup 4.gif" width="500" height="396" />

If you’re looking for the best Yoga workout in Malta, your first instinct might be to look for the best yoga studio around – but why limit yourself to an indoors setting? Malta is home to some of the most relaxing and beautiful natural beauty in the world, so surely practicing a relaxing art like yoga in nature is the best logical step.

Enter SUP Yoga, a yoga programme that combines traditional yoga with Stand-up Paddleboards. Picture that – balancing on a paddleboard in the middle of the clear blue sea while trying to reach positions that you’ve never reached before. Does that sound relaxing, or intimidating?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2112 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/sup-2.jpg" alt="sup 2" width="961" height="641" />

The truth is that SUP Yoga is very similar to all other forms of yoga, in the sense that anyone can do it with a little bit of practice, so any worries about it being too difficult should be quashed, even if SUP Yoga is slightly harder than ordinary yoga. In fact, SUP Yoga has grown considerably in popularity since being introduced to Malta in 2011, and that should be proof enough that anyone can partake if they want to.

SUP Yoga isn’t just ordinary in the yoga in the sea, though. It has specific benefits that you won’t necessarily get with regular yoga. The most obvious one is that SUP Yoga works even better than regular yoga as a workout, because you need to focus more on your technique and overall balance in order to practise it. Even though SUP Yoga is harmless (even if you fall), there’s an added adrenaline that will keep you on your toes a little bit more, and this will lead to bigger and better results. That means that your breathing will be improved and your core will become stronger through SUP Yoga than through normal yoga.

In addition to all of that, the outdoors aspect of SUP Yoga provides the perfect opportunity for you to connect with nature and connect with yourself. Something that is as physically, mentally, and spiritually fulfilling as yoga shouldn’t be confined to a sweaty room!

            [content] => We realise that over the past few months we’ve written quite a bit about music concerts and larger-scale festivals. We’re sure you get the message: there’s a lot of music happening in Malta. <em>Can we get back to the nature and history, please?</em>, you might be asking.

Rock the South isn’t just any festival, though. Now in its 6<sup>th</sup> edition, the event is somewhat historical in itself for its varied display of local and foreign acts, and it’s definitely very much anticipated by hundreds of music fans all over the island. It’s also a pretty significant event because it’s set in Marsascala. Most events we rave about happen in Valletta, Sliema, or similar areas – so we’re really stoked to promote this hub of culture in a completely different part of the island.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockthesouthmt/videos/1842282996011595/">https://www.facebook.com/rockthesouthmt/videos/1842282996011595/</a>

Taking place at Zion, Rock the South will be spread over three days, starting on the 21<sup>st</sup> of April (Friday) and ending on the 23<sup>rd</sup> (Sunday). Despite the name, there are acts on bill here that transcend rock music, though you can bet that the promise of distorted noise will be fulfilled.

Rock the South is the brainchild of Nick Morales, who works tirelessly year after year to make the event possible, while collaborating with some of the biggest entities in local music. This was first year in which the event partly assisted through a crowdfunding scheme, which we think is amazing as it really helps the communitarian aspect of the whole thing to shine through.

You can either opt for a weekend block ticket or individual day tickets. Tickets for Friday and Saturday cost €12, while the Sunday tickets are €15. The block ticket is just €30. What does that get you? Lots of live music, of course! Every day there will be two stages running parallel to each other (and no acts clash, which is great). You’ll also be treated to a nightly Silent Disco, which has been a staple of the Rock the South programme for many years now. This is exactly what it sounds like – a disco where you put on headphones and hear everything through them. It sounds quite surreal, and it is!

Let’s get to the live music line up though, because that’s definitely the heart of the whole festival. What can you expect on each day?

<strong>Friday 21<sup>st</sup> April</strong>

The first day of Rock the South sets the mood with a punky and charged bill of bands, including CEERA, Cryptic Street, Dusk, WakaTa, NAANGS, and headliners Beesqueeze.

It’s not all aggressive stuff, though. Also performing on Friday is Lois, a Spanish solo artist who promises a dreamier sounding set for anyone looking for vibes that are a little bit chiller.

<strong>Saturday 22<sup>nd</sup> April</strong>

If you think modern music is too full of singers that just don’t know when to shut up, you’re in luck as an instrumental stage in being set up featuring some of Malta’s most eclectic bands, such as Super Sponge Trio, Kingdoms of Dusk, and The Ranch. Headlining will be Sdang!, an Italian group that has already performed at Rock the South Twice. For the first time, the duo as a trio in Malta, as they’ve employed bassist Colin Edwin from the legendary Porcupine Tree!

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sdangband/videos/1952462771656206/">https://www.facebook.com/sdangband/videos/1952462771656206/</a>

If you’re more interested in bouncy, poppy tunes you’re in luck as the other stage features bands with a penchant for catchy songwriting, including Massacre House Party, Canvas Wall, and nosnow/noalps.

<strong>Sunday 23<sup>rd</sup> April</strong>

The final day at Rock the South is also the longest. While the previous two days begin at 6.30 pm, Sunday kicks off at 3 pm, so you don’t need to worry about how to spend the day before heading down to Zion! Afternoon sessions will be provided by Lucy’s Last, EXPLICIT, Jack’s Fusion, The Voyage, and Jeper Ejrup + Nick Jones.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-LEGQCHYDQ

The two evening stages once again will focus on diversity as one is geared towards more aggressive acts including BILA, Double Standard, Rage Against Society, Norm Rejection, Kill the Action, and LVX. The other stage will feature more experimental and melancholic acts including Oxygn, Eyes to Argus, CRUX, and YEWS.

            [content] => The Segway has been around since 2001, even though it feels like a very new invention Perhaps that’s because Segways were never a huge trend in Malta – though you would find them in the streets here and there you could never exactly find hundreds of people travelling around on them at a go. Which really begs the question: what make a Segway Tour an appealing in 2017?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2124" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/segway-2.gif" alt="segway 2.gif" width="700" height="394" />

The truth is that Segways have a lot of potential for touring purposes that is only beginning to be untapped now, at least in Malta. The advantages are undeniable. Take the fact, for example, that Segways aren’t particularly fast, reaching a max speed of 12 miles an hour.  ‘Wait’, you might be wondering. ‘How is that an advantage?’ Let’s put it this way – it forces you to appreciate your surroundings. In addition to this, Segways are safe and easy to operate, which means that you can direct even more attention to everything that’s happening around (though always check where you’re heading!).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2126" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/segway-3.gif" alt="segway 3.gif" width="384" height="288" />

The Segway is built to withstand multiple terrains, which makes them very versatile as a means of getting around Malta. It’s also a rather family friendly form of travelling, although only children aged 12 and upwards are allowed to join Segway tours in Malta.

With all this in mind, how do you join your first Segway tour in Malta?

Enter Malta Segway Tours, a company intent on helping people see the sights Malta has to offer in an innovative and creative way. So far there are only two main tour areas available through this company – Valletta and Dingli – but there are plenty of plans to expand. In the meantime, you can choose to enjoy the architectural and historical beauty of Valletta, or the natural beauty of Dingli and its cliffs.

The Valletta tour, as you’d expect, covers a lot of historical insight into what makes Valletta the wonder that it is. The tour lasts an hour and a half, and you can then opt to visit The Malta Experience show that lasts another 45 minutes. The package costs a very reasonable €55 per person.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2128" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/segway-4.gif" alt="segway 4.gif" width="359" height="202" />
There are actually two Dingli tours that you can opt for. One is a ‘Funtastic’ tour that takes you through the traditional village of Dingli and ends at the breath-taking Buskett Gardens, while the ‘Adventure’ tour is much more nature-centric, so gliding through the cliffy area and other natural locations in Dingli is what you can expect here. The tours cost €49 and €79, respectively. The Funtastic tour lasts an hour and forty-five minutes, while the Adventure tour lasts three hours. You’d definitely be getting your money’s worth!

If you’re eager to join the fun and ride into your first Segway tour experience, all you need to do is book through the following page: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours">https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours</a>.

            [content] => One wonderful thing about Malta is that despite our size, all sports get love in one way or another. Even though football fans yell the loudest – or rather, they yell in the highest numbers – rugby is an incredibly close second in terms of popularity. Some people make the argument that as far as how Malta fares internationally, rugby actually surpasses football by a wide margin, but we won’t get into that here!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rugby-3.gif" alt="rugby 3.gif" width="500" height="232" />

What is not up for debate though is how exciting Maltese rugby is. It’s more than the loyal fan-base. Malta’s national rugby team is really quite formidable and has great potential to become even stronger. The team’s nickname is The Rams (L-Imtaten) which is a sure reflection of this strength.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2136 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rugby-2.jpg" alt="rugby 2.jpg" width="259" height="273" />

If you didn’t know that fact, odds are there are plenty more you’re not aware of. That’s why this article is all about putting Maltese rugby in the limelight it deserves to be in! Read on for more facts about the sport in Malta:

<strong>Rugby was brought into Malta by the British</strong>

Perhaps this is a somewhat predictable fact in hindsight, but it’s always intriguing to see how the British influenced Malta in almost every imaginable way! The first rugby club in Malta was set up in 1946 called the Overseas Rugby Club and was mostly made up of British servicemen.

However, rugby didn’t really gain much of a following until the 1970s, when a few schools began teaching the game to students. Despite this, one could find the first influx of local clubs at the beginning of the 1990s, thanks to the revival of the Overseas Rugby Club and the establishing of clubs such as the Kavallieri, the Stompers, and the University Rugby Football Club (now known as Alligator RFC). Nowadays there are plenty of other local clubs.

<strong>The Malta National Rugby Union Team is relatively new
</strong>
Malta’s national rugby team played its first match in 2000, against Moldova. That’s 17 years ago, which is a long time if you’re a human being, but not so much if you’re an international sports club.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2138 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rugby-4.gif" alt="rugby 4.gif" width="294" height="233" />

It’s also pretty safe to say that Malta started out as underdogs. We lost our first match 58-8, and lost our second match against Belgium in the same year with a score of 26-0. However, Malta would go on to secure its first win against Monaco the following year.

<strong>Maltese Rugby has seen considerable success</strong>

Malta is currently ranked 42<sup>nd</sup> in the World Rugby world rankings, which is not too shabby at all! Although Malta has never qualified for the Rugby World Cup, in 2007 we did enter the qualification tournament and made it to Pool B of the third round.

Malta currently competes in the European Division 2A and in the 2013-14 season finished 2<sup>nd</sup> to the Netherlands.
<strong>
Malta is Playing this Saturday at the Hibernian’s Stadium
</strong>
Malta will be taking on Israel on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of April! Whether you’ve never watched a rugby match in Malta, or whether you’re a diehard fan, this an excellent opportunity to witness one of the things that Malta does best.

            [content] => Not many people might accept an invitation to go abseiling right away, especially if they’ve never attempted the sport before. You can’t really blame them – descending a rock face with the use of rope can be terrifying. That is, until you learn how safe it is when done properly.

Abseiling is not as dangerous as you might initially think. Many people learn how to abseil as children and it also requires less equipment than regular climbing activities. That being said, abseiling should always be done as a controlled climb with people overseeing you, and only the sturdiest equipment and top protection measures should be utilised.

There are plenty of reasons why abseiling is worth your time. Considered to be an adventure sport or an extreme sport, there’s very little else that can provide the sure rush and adrenaline that abseiling does. It’s a rush that everybody should feel a few times in their life! In fact, we’d go as far as to say that such adrenaline is really healthy. Abseiling teaches you that taking risks; that making that first push is a liberating step. Abseiling teaches you to forego your inhibitions.



<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2144" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/abseiling-2.gif" alt="abseiling 2.gif" width="528" height="297" />



Plus, abseiling is a legitimate sport, in that it requires physical effort and mental focus. It’s definitely a way of burning the calories, and though we doubt it will become a daily part of your efforts to keep fit, it’s a great way of changing up the pace.

Perhaps the most wonderful part about abseiling, though is that you become immersed in your surroundings. Nothing is more beautiful than climbing down a rock face knowing that you are part of that whole structure, while breathing in the fresh air and the scents of nature around you.

That’s why Malta is an amazing place to abseil in! With so many beautiful landscapes everywhere, it’s hard not to get the impulse to climb down them! From Bahrija to Xlendi and countless other areas, if you’re an abseiling nut you’ll likely never run out of places to practise at. If you do, you can always revisit some of the same ones – they never stop being gorgeous!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2149" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mg_8020closersmaller.jpg" alt="_MG_8020closeramp;smaller.jpg" width="1500" height="1200" />

Of course, as we’ve already stressed, abseiling should be conducted as a group activity, with professionals overseeing you, especially if you’re a newbie or simply don’t have years of experience under your belt. The best way to start your venture in abseiling adventures is through Fun Malta, whose collaboration with MC Adventure guarantees access to some of the most exciting spots for the sport.

Being very flexible they can cater to both small and large groups and will organise routes based on the overall skill and experience level present. You can start off with shorter routes and build your way to something a bit more daring. The longest abseil route available is over 75m, but of course beginners will not start here! There are only a few unique abseiling spots on offer, including an urban bridge in Mosta.

            [content] => If you’ve been following our blog recently, you might have noticed that we’re really putting an effort into providing different ways of immersing yourself in the beauty that is our natural Maltese landscape. Malta has such an endless supply of nature that we can’t imagine anyone getting tired of it, but it’s precisely because Malta’s beauty is so tireless that finding new ways of exploring it is the ultimate way of appreciating it.

Kayaking is just one of the ways that you can become one with the archipelago, but what a way it is.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2157" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kayak-1.gif" alt="kayak 1.gif" width="480" height="360" />

Of course, if you want to travel around Malta’s sea, the options are practically limitless. Why opt for a kayak? We like to think of kayaking as a best-of-all-worlds kind of vessel. By that we mean that you get all the serenity that comes with being on a boat (perhaps even more so because there are no noisy engines) and you also get a serious workout in the process, especially with regard to your upper body. We know that exercise is not on everyone’s minds when it comes to these things, but it’s always worth mentioning!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2158" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kayak-2.gif" alt="kayak 2.gif" width="350" height="192" />

Kayaking is also great for another reason that is definitely underrated, which is that kayaks are better for the fish in the sea than most other kinds of sea vessels. Because kayaks are so stealthy and smooth in design, the fish will not even notice your presence. We do understand that some people do opt to go fishing on kayaks, but that’s another (umm) kettle of fish entirely.

Have we convinced you that kayaking is a wonderful activity to try in Malta? Great! The question that remains is how to get started. Fortunately, the answer is even easier than the question! All you have to do is make a booking through Fun Malta!

Fun Malta is a booking agent for MC Adventure, a group of adventure-driven professionals that can organise kayaking activities you’ll never forget. Perfect for small or large groups, there are a multitude of options available when looking into your next kayaking trip. You can even opt for a half-day activity or a full-day one!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2159" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kayak-3.gif" alt="kayak 3.gif" width="480" height="360" />

For the (understandably) safety-conscious: thanks to the experts at MC Adventure accompanying you every step of the way, there’s no need for worry as you’ll get all the help you need. That means beginners are more than welcome to join in on the fun.

The best part of course is that there are multiple spots that are suitable for kayaking and this is reflected in the range of tours on offer. One of the most popular ones include a kayaking adventure to Comino, which is full of natural arches and caves. Another takes you to the delightfully underrated area of Selmun Bay and the St Paul’s Islands (also known as Selmunett)!

                )

            [content] => The suggestion of renting of car when spending time in Malta might seem a little odd. After all, everyone knows our island is tiny, and in addition to that fact we even have a pretty efficient bus service that can take you anywhere you need to go. Renting a car seems unnecessary, right?

Not quite. Despite the fact that people certainly do get by using our public transport system as well as taxis when needed, driving is still the number one transport method of choice in Malta and there are plenty of reasons for that.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2164" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rental-1.gif" alt="rental 1.gif" width="400" height="225" />

We’re not implying that using a car is the only way to get by, and if you’re only going to visit the islands for a week or so it might definitely be worth your while to make do without one. Using a bus comes with its own advantages too – if you’re getting used to Malta it can be great to simply gaze at your surroundings through the window without having to worry about the road.

However, for anyone staying a bit longer, car rental should definitely be a consideration. Here’s why:

<b>Trips are usually shorter</b>

Although you will hear some inevitable stories of late buses, they are usually punctual. However, a bus ride can be lengthened for a few reasons, including the bus driver having to stop every few minutes to pick up more passengers. You might also find that to get to certain destinations you’ll have to catch two buses, which can increase the waiting and journey time quite a bit. With a rental car you can go straight to your destination without having to make extra stops.
<b>You can travel when you like</b>

This point comes in two parts. When you choose to catch the bus, you of course need to stick to the schedule, and when you catch a taxi you need to wait for it to arrive.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2166" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rental-2.gif" alt="rental 2.gif" width="480" height="270" />

The other issue is that night buses are somewhat limited in Malta, so you will have to pay attention to your watch to make sure you’re going to catch the last one. Alternatively, you could again opt for the taxi, but it seems like an unnecessary expense when you could just drive home when you likeoutwithout having to plan u a schedule.
<b>
You can take spontaneous detours</b>

What happens if you’re on the bus and you suddenly decide you want to change plans? You’d have to get off, figure out your new route, and waste a lot of time.

With a rental car, all you need is punch your new location in your GPS and you’ll be good to go!

<b>Rental cars allow you to budget better
</b>
Though renting a car is likely going to be as expensive or even more expensive than making use of alternative transport options, the fact that you’ll have the payment laid down means that you can plan the rest of your budget around it. Taxi costs accumulate, which means that you might end up less willing to splurge because you won’t be quite sure of how much money is going into transport on any particular day.

<b>You can battle Malta’s temperamental weather</b>

It’s no secret that the weather in Malta does what it likes when it likes. Why wait for a bus in the boiling sun or pouring rain when you can travel with a car roof over your head and AC/heater options at the ready?

            [content] => <span style="color:#353535;">‘<span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Blood, sweat, and tears’. This phrase, coined by Sir Winston Churchill, is now associated with hard work of any kind, and we think that it’s absolutely appropriate when talking about The Grid, Malta’s most challenging obstacle race ever. We’d love to tell you that Grid participants can bypass the blood and tears component of it all, and only have ample amounts of sweat in their future, but we’re that’s not exactly true. </span></span></span>

<span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">You see, gearing up for The Grid takes effort, and lots of it. You need to be really physically fit if you want to hold your own against the rest. Luckily, you’ve got until the 3</span></span></span><span style="color:#353535;"><sup><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">rd</span></span></sup></span><span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> of June to get there, which gives you about a month. How much exercise can you do in a month? It’s time to find out!</span></span></span>

<span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">We’re not trying to make signing up for The Grid sound too masochistic. All challenges of this calibre are going to be tough, and as goes the cliché, there is great reward in such dedication, so we genuinely think this is a great opportunity for anyone over the age of 16 and physically fit enough to give it a shot.</span></span></span>

<a name="_GoBack"></a> <span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Despite the name that The Grid has already made for itself, this is only the second year that the annual event has been around, with the first iteration taking place in May of last year. This June, one can look forward to a lot of similarity from the previous year, as the event will be held on the same 15km Armed Forces Assault course in Pembroke. Can you think of a course with a more fitting name? We sure can’t!</span></span></span>

<span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">15k is a long distance, of course, and this is reflected in the wide range of obstacles you’ll have to conquer during the event. Last year’s obstacles included hay stacks, monkey bars, hurdles, large walls, and high jumps, and we’re sure that this year will see some even more creative challenges!</span></span></span>

<span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2186" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-gridm.jpg" alt="the gridm.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></span></span></span><span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><i>Photo credit: Thomas Smith Shipping</i></span></span></span>

We must profess that one reason we’re so enthusiastic about The Grid is that the organising team itself seems so eager for it to be a success. Taking their ethos of determination every step of the way, the team claims that The Grid will happen irrespective of weather conditions, so you’re going to have to march whether it’s sunny or rainy. Of course, if weather conditions compromise the safety of the event, that’s a different issue entirely and one that would be addressed.

If you’re ready to carry the same ethos of determination, you’re definitely still in time to sign up for The Grid. Head over to thegridmalta.com to check out any details we might not have included here, including price points and how to go about your online registration.

            [content] => ‘Water, water everywhere – and not a drop to drink’, wrote Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his famous poem, ‘The Rime of the Ancient Mariner’. Well, the sea in Malta might not be potable, but it sure is great for scuba diving.

We’ve spoken about exploring Malta on land. We’ve written about connecting with Malta’s beauty on cliffy heights. We’ve noted that there are many ways to appreciate the archipelago while in the sea. Malta is truly beautiful from all angles – but what happens when we go for an even deeper angle, namely under the sea?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2195" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-1.gif" alt="scuba 1.gif" width="480" height="360" />

In fact, you might not be surprised to learn that Malta is consistently rated as being one of the top destinations worldwide for scuba diving. It’s more than the fact that there’s sea all around us. Malta is full of intriguing dive sites because of the abundance of caves and reefs that make for gorgeous natural structures below the sea. Just as captivating are the myriad historical wrecks that you can observe first hand when scuba diving.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2196" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-2.gif" alt="scuba 2.gif" width="550" height="310" />

In addition to the beauty and intriguing stuff that lies under the depths of Malta’s seas, scuba diving in Malta is also an excellent choice because the variety in diving sites makes it suitable for all kinds of divers from absolute beginners to professionals. In fact, there are numerous sheltered and shallow bays that even the most inexperienced of divers can feel safe in.

<a name="_GoBack"></a><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2198" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-3.gif" alt="scuba 3.gif" width="640" height="360" />If you’re interested in testing out the waters of scuba diving (quite literally), Fun Malta is once again the gateway to adventure. By heading over to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving">https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving</a>, you can book your next scuba diving appointment directly, after checking out the different packages and price points on offer.

You can pick the right package for you based on your experience level. The beginner package, for example, covers completely controlled environments, and your guides will of course oversee you every step of the way. Commonly visited areas for this package include Valletta, Manoel island, Sirens Bay, Qawra Point, and Cirkewwa. The wide range of locations ensures that beginners aren’t simply subjected to sub-par dives, as there’s as much beauty and excitement to look forward to as there is in more advanced diving areas.

Furthermore, the beginner package is a great choice if you want to try out scuba diving as a unique family activity! However, your child will not be allowed to join unless he or she is at least 10 years old.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2198 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-3.gif" alt="scuba 3" width="640" height="360" />

If you eventually decide you want to take scuba diving a little more seriously, you can also book PADI courses through Fun Malta, which will certify you as being eligible for more advanced dives!

Summer in Malta is synonymous with long, lazy days at the beach, golden tans, and that amazing feeling you get when you push your toes into the cool, shade-drenched sand. Whether you’re hitting the Maltese Islands for a few days, a couple of weeks, or even months, here are a few of the best beaches in Malta to help you unwind this summer! Grab your beach bag.
<ol>
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/blue-lagoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Blue Lagoon</a></b></li>
</ol>
Known the world over for its crystal-clear water and idyllic setting in Comino, Lagoon is an absolute must-see during your time here. To enjoy Comino and Blue Lagoon properly, you’ll need to spend at least one full morning or afternoon there, if not the whole day!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2262 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/blue-lagoon.jpg" alt="Blue Lagoon" width="2946" height="1964" />


<ol start="2">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/golden-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Bay</a> </b></li>
</ol>
Nestled between two sides of unmistakably Maltese terrain, you’ll find Golden Bay – the very first beach in Malta to get the coveted Blue Flag status. It’s perfect for families, and has all the amenities you’ll need for a very comfortable day at the beach. If you’ve got the time, stay and watch the sun set!

<ol start="3">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/ghajn-tuffieha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Għajn Tuffieħa</a></b></li>
</ol>
Just around the corner from Golden Bay, you’ll find its equally-attractive sibling – Għajn Tuffieħa. It’s an incredibly popular beach, and <i>can </i>get a little busy at times, but the sweeping, panoramic views are so beautiful, it’ll be worth it.

<ol start="4">
	<li><b>St. Peter’s Pool </b></li>
</ol>
If you’re feeling a little adventurous and don’t mind heading off the beaten track, then look no further than St. Peter’s Pool. This rocky bay is generally quiet, and not too far from the charming fishing village of Marsaxlokk – why not stop there for a delicious meal before heading back home?

<ol start="5">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/ghadira-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mellieħa Bay</a></b></li>
</ol>
Known to locals as Għadira, this is the island’s largest sandy beach and has quite a long stretch of shallow surf – perfect if you’re travelling with children. Għadira is generally quite busy, but it’s easy to get to and is Blue Flag certified too. There are bus stops really close by, and you’ll even find a few great options if you want a bite to eat during the day.

<ol start="6">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/paradise-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradise Bay</a></b></li>
</ol>
This aptly-named bay is tucked away near Ċirkewwa, cradled by white cliffs and perfectly-positioned to give you some great views of Gozo and Comino. Popular with families and snorkelers in particular, this beach offers you the chance to kick back, relax, and get to know the (underwater) locals better.

<b>BONUS: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/ramla-l-hamra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramla L-Ħamra</a></b>

Your Maltese adventure is incomplete without a visit to Gozo. Ramla L-Ħamra (The Red Sandy Beach) is a beautiful stretch of deep golden sand on the northern side of the island. Look to the eastern part of the hillside, and you’ll find a pathway that’ll take you to Calypso Cave, the same one Homer talks about in his famous work, The Odyssey!

            [content] => Mothers. Sometimes, they can drive you up the wall, or nag you to the four corners of the earth. Little disputes here and there are inevitable with your mum. Regardless of all of that, your mother will always be one of the most important people in your life; perhaps the person who will always mean best for you even if you sometimes see the world a little differently.

Your mother gave you the greatest gift of all (no prizes for guessing what that is), and the 14<sup>th</sup> of May is an excellent opportunity for you to show appreciation for it. You might not be able to ever ‘return the favour’, but treating your mother in a thoughtful way is the best way to show you care.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2286" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mum-1.gif" alt="mum 1.gif" width="480" height="362" />
If you and your mother are in Malta this Mother’s Day, there’s are limitless options to choose from when it comes to making your one and only mum feel special. You’re the best person to know what she likes, but in case you needed some gift guidance (mothers can be an elusive bunch, after all), this article offers a few ideas!

<b>Get her a custom bouquet or floral décor
</b>
Though some people appreciate flowers as a gift, other see them as the easy way out. Grab a bouquet on the way home from work, and you’ve got a gift that smells nice but you put zero thought in.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2288" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mum-2.gif" alt="mum 2.gif" width="500" height="500" />

Going the custom route revitalises the whole thing, though. Malta is chockful of floral design experts that can put together flower arrangements that really represent what your mother is all about. Do any specific flowers remind you of her? Are there any colour patterns that she really finds soothing? A custom floral artist, like Alistair Fenech from Alistair Floral Design, can put together exactly what you need.

<b>Book a Family Photo Session with a Professional Photographer</b>

Material objects can be lovely, but nothing beats the warmth of good memories, and memories are no better captured than in photographs. Thanks to the power of the internet, pictures can be stored online forever, so the memories will always be there.

Though a smartphone might suffice when it comes to capturing spontaneous family moments, a professional with a great equipment and a keen eye will provide high quality and artistic photos that you can truly cherish forever.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2290" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mum-3.gif" alt="mum 3.gif" width="400" height="275" />

Your mother, like most mothers, might be the kind of person who always pines for more photos. If so, this is definitely the option we recommend the most.

<b>Buy her jewellery/clothing unique to Malta</b>

Clothing and jewellery are two options that you can’t go wrong with. What could make your mother feel better than an item that accentuates her beauty in addition to being a thoughtful gift from her child?

Some brands, though fancy indeed, can be found all around the world. Unless you know for a fact that your mother wants a specific item from a specific brand, we implore to do a little more research and opt for a unique Maltese option you won’t be able to get anywhere else. One example of this would be the gorgeous scarves made by the illustrious Saz Mifsud.

Most people in the modern world will have flown on a plane at least once in their life, and everyone will have his own personal reaction to the experience of flying. For some people, it’s exhilarating, for others terrifying. For many, it’s a rather mundane experience, which is pretty understandable considering that most people are ordinary passengers who don’t have do anything but sit down, read the in-flight magazine and eat their questionable complementary meal.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2296" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/flight-1.gif" alt="flight 1.gif" width="384" height="270" />
What if you get to take control of an aircraft for a little while, though? That completely changes the average person’s relationship to flying. While it might sound scary, we definitely encourage anyone with even the slightest hunger for adventure to give a trial flight a go!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/flight-2.gif" alt="flight 2.gif" width="500" height="377" />

There are two main reasons why we encourage the experience so much. The first is there’s an unmatchable rush of adrenaline that occurs in such an adventure. A lot of the activities we promote tend to be adrenaline-filled, but this is arguably one of the most unique things we’ve ever vouched for, and the thrill is really on another level as a result. The adrenaline might definitely be a product of fear, and while the scariness of the situation will be present, but you will of course be supervised every step of the way and so your safety will be a top priority on your trial flight.

The second reason hits a little closer to home in the very literal sense. Though you can enjoy a trial flight in many countries around the world, we are of course a Maltese organisation, and are recommending the activity as one to take up specifically while in Malta! Getting the chance to experience Malta from an aerial point of view is truly magical, and while you’ll have you keep your eyes on the sky, you’ll definitely be able to enjoy all the sights below you.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2299" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/flight-3.gif" alt="flight 3.gif" width="500" height="308" />

If you’re pining for your next (or first ever) trial flight, you can book directly through <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/trial-flights">https://www.funmalta.com/trial-flights</a>. You can choose from four different packages at different price points based on your preferences. You can opt for the introductory flight that lasts 30 minutes, the group flight in which everybody gets a turn, the extended flight, or the premium flight that lasts a whole 75 minutes. All four options have one thing in common: you’ll be exposed to gorgeous sights, and (comfortably) dizzying heights!

Every year, thousands upon thousands of holiday-makers and adventure-seekers flock to Malta to take advantage of all the sun, sea, and fun this island gem has to offer. Whether you’re new to this kind of climate or a seasoned pro, take a look at some summer essentials to make sure you’re at your best this summer in Malta.

<h3>Sunglasses amp; a hat</h3>

</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/11yQPgjaNAyQJW.gif" alt="Movies GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

One of the things people love most about our little island is the golden sunshine we enjoy most of the year! Be sure to protect yourself from getting <i>too much </i>sun by making sure you’ve got a good pair of sunnies and maybe even a hat for extra points. If you’re prone to sunburn, it might be a good idea to have some sunblock on hand for those long days out – nothing ruins a holiday faster than looking like a lobster in pain.

<h3>Water (and more water)</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/IfYbM2sytuAQU.gif" alt="Disney GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

Staying hydrated is important in your normal,day-to-day life, but if you’re dealing with warmer weather than you’re used to, then it becomes doubly important.
<ol start="3">

<h3>Lip Balm</h3>

</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/l0HlFSuG4CVaSCzOE.gif" alt="NOW That's Music GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

Let’s face it – dry lips are basically evil incarnate and devilishly uncomfortable. Don’t fall victim to the cracked, burning discomfort that comes from neglecting your lips – get your hands on some good lip balm, preferably with UV protection.
<ol start="4">
	<li>
<h3>Flip Flops</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/26BREJOhqNEhmNDxK.gif" alt="Andy Samberg GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

This should be your footwear of choice unless you plan on going on some sort of trek. Flip flops are perfect – you can just kick them off and dip your feet into the crystal-blue sea for a little paddle. If you’re style conscious, don’t worry – they’ve come a long way since the 90s.
<ol start="5">

<h3>A Fan</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/cYnzSevqzhVoA.gif" alt="While You Were Sleeping GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

For some sweet relief when you’re feeling a bit too warm, get yourself one of those fans you’ve seen your grandmother use. She know what’s up, and you know she’s feeling chill as anything.
<ol start="6">
	<li>
<h3>A Good Book</h3>

</ol>

A lazy summer’s day is incomplete without a good book to enjoy while you work on your tan or relax in the shade!

Trust us – you’re going to want to remember your Maltese summer. With so many breath-taking sights to see and experiences to enjoy you’ll be glad to have a camera on hand to leave you with a memento or two. Of course, if you have one of the latest smartphones, you won’t need an actual camera, but for that hint of nostalgia, why not treat yourself to an instant camera?

"western"><strong>Qigong amp; Taijiquan Seminar by GM Maurizio Zanetti – 27th May</strong>
"western"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2323" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/learn-2.gif" alt="learn 2.gif" width="200" height="200" />
"western">Martial arts are always a phenomenal way of staying fit and relaxing the mind simultaneously. Yet, most people are unaware of just how many different varieties of martial arts actually exist. Most of us can name four or five styles off the top of our heads, and we’re willing to bet that Qigong amp; Taijiquan aren’t usually one of them.
"western">Yet, sometimes the things least familiar to us can be the most rewarding. That’s why we recommend going to the Ramla Bay Resort to check out this amazing seminar, given by a European master, that can give you passion for a practice you never even knew existed!
"western"><strong>Publish and Market your Book – 21<sup>st</sup> May 2017</strong>
"western">There are so many inspired writers around who have very little knowledge of how to break into the literature scene. You might have no contacts, or you might be counting on fate to have you discovered. Don’t! Just like any life venture, results come with the right networking.
That’s why any up and coming author should really contact Filfla Publishing about their new initiative that helps people learn the dos and don’ts of getting your novel off your computer screen and into bookstores.
"western"><strong>SED – Science Camp – 23<sup>rd</sup> May</strong>

<h1 class="western"></h1>
This one is for kids! If your children are new to the world of science, the SED Science camp is a brilliant gateway in. There are monthly camp sessions happening until September, but if you won’t be in Malta till then you can simply send your child there a few times. One thing is for sure – SED is geared to give your child a deep appreciation for science and how it applies to life.

            [content] => There’s a lot that can be said about Malta’s thriving nightlife, but that’s not exactly what this blog post is about<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">. </span></span>Whether you’re staying in Malta for a week or for several years, you’ll definitely find time to enjoy the island’s night time entertainment culture, whether you’re into clubs, concerts, or literally anything else under the Mediterranean sun (or perhaps we should say ‘moon’?).

Don’t hit the clubs just yet, though. We strongly recommend that check your schedule and fit in one other night time activity: a night tour of the island.



[caption id="attachment_2332" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class=" size-full wp-image-2332 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/night-2.jpg" alt="night 2" width="500" height="390" /> <i>Vittoriosa by night</i>[/caption]



You can bet money that if the Maltese islands are gorgeous by day, they’re equally gorgeous by night. People are recognising this more and more with each passing year, and several initiatives have been taken to celebrate Malta’s moon-kissed charm. One such initiative is the annual BirguFest, which is famous for its Birgu by Candlelight scheme. That’s exactly what you’d expect it to be: one of Malta’s maritime cities completely illuminated by candlelight.



[caption id="attachment_2341" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2341 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/night-3.jpg" alt="night 3].jpg" width="500" height="333" /> <i>Valletta at night</i>[/caption]



The Malta Night Tours are a little different though as they’re set on educating you about the cities you explore in a unique, captivating way. There are three tours available so far: The Vittoriosa Tour (so you get to see Birgu by night even if you won’t be in Malta for BirguFest), the Mdina Night Tour, and the Valletta Night Tour. Each tour takes approximately one and a half hours, and attendees can also opt to gather for a dinner at the site location. Each tour is led by a professional and licensed tour guide.
The question you must be asking, of course, is why you should opt for a night tour, as opposed to a day time tour. There are more reasons than you’d expect! For starters, a night tour will allow you to enjoy the city of your choice at a much less busy time, meaning you can ogle at the sights without getting caught in the middle of surrounding hustle and bustle.



[caption id="attachment_2343" align="aligncenter" width="308"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2343" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/night-4.jpg" alt="night 4.jpg" width="308" height="254" /> <em>Mdina by night</em>[/caption]



Night tours are also a great option for anyone who might be working in Malta and needs a way of familiarising themselves more with the archipelago. You can work in the morning and learn about the island after hours! It’s great for tourists too though – apart from the fact that you get to see Malta in a new light, a night tour can be a strategic way of immersing yourself in Malta’s history and culture on your first day if your flight is scheduled slightly late.

Just like most other tours, the Night Tours are an excellent group option. Each tour can accommodate up to 10 people. It also costs €108, and splitting that number between a high number of people makes the tour super affordable.

            [content] => Let’s be honest – packing is probably the most annoying part of any holiday, no matter where you’re going. Some of us are packing ninjas, able to get organised and sort out a suitcase at a moment’s notice without breaking a sweat. Most of us mere mortals, however, need a little help – and possibly some divine intervention – to get things done. Without further ado, here are a few tips to get you packing like a pro.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/H5Q964PL6V1ao.gif" alt="No GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>1 | Make a List (or two)</b>

To-do list are fabulous little things that make us feel a sense of calm and control over the situation. But you can’t just stop at writing the list – you need to get down to business like Mulan in that Disney movie. Start off with a list of essentials, and make another one for the ‘nice to have’ items that you technically could live without. Pack the essentials first (including those important documents and some cash in the local currency) before moving on to the ‘nice to have’ bits. And you know you don’t need 3 pairs of flip flops. Put them down.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/ufNRtLbvvqnBK.gif" alt="Clothes GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>2 | Roll on</b>

You might already know someone who <i>rolls </i>their clothes instead of folding them the way mummy taught you to all those years ago. It might look a little strange at first, but give it a try – you’ll be surprised at how much space and time you’ll save! Think “sushi master”.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/RO023EYTyk5yg.gif" alt="Sushi GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>3 | Accessories at the top</b>

Leave accessories and smaller items to the very end to lessen the chances of finding that your new pair of earrings has become a crumble mess of metal and gemstones at the bottom of your bag. Placing these items further up in the bag-hierarchy will also help you to find these bits and pieces more easily when it comes to unpacking.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/2Ylp4JECyTYRi.gif" alt="Swag GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>4 | Know your limits</b>

Contrary to what <i>Mean Girls</i> may have taught us, there is indeed a limit. Be realistic about how many pairs of shoes you actually <b>need</b> versus how many you want to take with you (because you want options), and try to pack versatile items that you can use to style into a few different outfits. Also, be practical about how many pairs of underwear you need. Seriously.

<b>5 | A word about liquids</b>

Or rather, three words: Zip. Lock. Bags. It might seem odd at first, but putting your liquids into these plastic bags will protect your beloved belongings from being covered in whatever decided to leak during your 3-hour flight. The last thing you need is a suitcase full of sunblock to go with your post-holiday blues.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/P4133zeloooHm.gif" alt="Panic GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>6 | Lock it down amp; dress it up </b>

If you haven’t already bought one – invest in a good, teeny-tiny lock to keep your things safe. Oh, and if you’re one of those people who struggle to recognise their own suitcase when you hit baggage reclaim, consider tying a colourful piece of ribbon to your bag, or buying a distinctive tag that’ll help you spot your suitcase (before you pick up someone else’s).

<b>1 | Flora’s, Naxxar</b>

This sweet little hangout is a real treat – pun fully intended. The décor is charming and every cupcake and pot of tea is baked and brewed with love.

<b>2 | Busy Bee, Msida</b>

Busy Bee is something of an institution around the Msida area. The café’s history dates back to 1933, when a gentleman called Ċensu Friggieri opened ‘Busy Bee Bar’, a confectionary serving up some of Malta’s best-loved sweets and treats, including the much-loved Cannoli.

<b>3 | Charles Grech, Valletta</b>

If you’re in the mood for something a little on the fancy side, look no further than Charles Grech in our beautiful capital, Valletta! The café is in Republic street, just past the ruins of the majestic Royal Opera House, now an open-air performance space.

<b>4 | Café Jubilee, Valletta and Gzira</b>

Take a step back in time and nestle into a cosy corner over at Café Jubilee! The vintage décor and delicious food and drink will keep you coming back for more, and you might even get the chance to enjoy a bit of live music while you dig in to some dessert!

<b>5 | Fontanella, Mdina </b>

By far one of the most well-known cafés on the island, Fontanella is the ideal place to rest your tired legs after a full day of sightseeing around Malta’s old capital, affectionately nicknamed “The Silent City”. Our top tip? Try the chocolate cake.

            [content] => The future is here, and its name is Jetfly. Just take a look at the cover photo in this article. Doesn’t that look like something you want to do right now? Or do you find it somewhat terrifying?

If you’re still trying to figure out what Jetfly is all about, it’s a pretty straightforward concept. You strap a water-propelled jetpack to your body that allows you to hover 10 metres into the air. Although that might seem scary, the fact of the matter is that the technology used for Jetfly is advanced enough that controlling the jetpack is pretty straightforward and relies on light fingertip control. You can move in all directions as well as land with ease.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2374" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/jetfly-gif.gif" alt="jetfly gif.gif" width="500" height="312" />
<i>Kind of like this, but over water.</i>

Though we’re pretty sure that the main point of attraction with jetflying lies in the pure thrill of the activity itself, but a definite bonus is that being propelled into the air in that way will give you a gorgeous view of your Maltese surroundings!

Oh, and just in case you needed a slightly more cultural spin on this article, the jetflying team operates from a historic boat, the Cutty Jean, which really adds a new depth to the whole experience.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2376" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/jetfly-2.jpg" alt="jetfly 2.jpg" width="960" height="540" />

There are two main options when it comes to your Jetfly adventure: you can either fly solo, or in tandem with a certified instructor, which is also known as the Joy Ride. The differences are pretty straightforward.

If you choose the tandem option, you’ll mostly be controlled by the instructor and you can simply enjoy the ride without having to worry about getting to grips with the way everything works. If you don’t plan on jetflying regularly, or if you have younger children (children must be at least 4 years old to jetfly in tandem), this could definitely be the choice for you.

The solo option includes an actual lesson on how to manoeuvre and you can put what you’ve learnt to practice as you won’t have the instructor controlling your every step as you fly! This is the option we recommend if you like to be a bit more intuitive and adventurous. It’s also great for anyone aged 12 and up.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2378 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/jetfly-3.jpg" alt="jetfly 3" width="951" height="607" />

There are a few other factors that might influence your decision. For example, the Joy Ride option comes with a weight limit of 75 kg while the Solo option has no such restriction. Price might also factor in, but the difference is actually really negligible: Solo flights cost €80 while the Joy Ride is €70.

As usual, there’s no need to worry about how and where you can book your Jetfly experience, as you can book directly through <a href="http://www.funmalta.com/jetfly">www.funmalta.com/jetfly</a>!

            [content] => You might have never thought so, but Malta has definitely had its fair share of celebrities over the years, and some of them have had a substantial impact even on an international level. There have also been plenty of celebrities and rising stars with Maltese blood in them, like Britney Spears, Bryan Adams, and Tash Sultana. However, this article is more concerned with celebrities who were either at least born in Malta or lived in Malta for a substantial portion of their lives.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and because of that we’ll definitely have a couple more of these in the near future. Keep an eye out! Until then, here’s our first batch of Maltese celebs.

<b>Marama Corlett</b>

<b><img class=" size-full wp-image-2383 alignleft" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-1.jpg" alt="celebs 1.jpg" width="400" height="558" /></b>Of all the people in this list, Marama Corlett is probably the one that’s the current talk of the town. That’s definitely to be expected from someone who has acted in television series like <b>Sinbad</b> and <b>Rina</b>, and films like <b>Guardians of the Galaxy</b> and <b>Maleficent</b>!

Corlett’s latest venture is in a new science fiction television series called <b>Blood Drive</b> that is definitely not suitable for kids! We’ll refrain from discussing the details here, but do check it out if you’re into shows that aren’t afraid to toe the line of gore and debauchery!



<b>Joseph Calleia</b>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2386 alignright" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-2.jpg" alt="celebs 2.jpg" width="245" height="298" />

No, not our beloved tenor! Joseph Calleia was a Maltese-born American actor and singer who lived between 1897 and 1975. Calleia featured in numerous works across various genres including musical comedy, Broadway, and was also well-known for excelling at acting as villains in Hollywood films.

Some of the films you’ll be able to find Calleia in include <b>Algiers</b>, <b>Five Came Back</b>, <b>Golden Boy</b>, <b>Gilda</b>, and <b>Touch of Evil</b> (considered to be his magnum opus in terms of performance).

<b>Joseph Calleja</b>

We had to include Malta’s most famous tenor, of course. Though Calleja is respected by practically everyone locally, perhaps it’s safe to say that not all that many Maltese people understand that he is not just a national treasure. Calleja has gained various recognitions of his talent including winning the 1998 Caruso Competition in Milan and also winning a prize in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%A1cido_Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operalia_International_Opera_Competition">Operalia International Opera Competition</a> in 1999. Furthermore, Calleja is a member of the Board of Directors of the European Academy of Music Theatre!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2388" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-3.jpg" alt="celebs 3.jpg" width="662" height="441" />

We’re sure that many people also still remember when Joseph Calleja was the guest tenor at the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in 2012, where he performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra!

<b>Marc Storace</b>

<b><img class=" size-full wp-image-2390 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-4.jpg" alt="celebs 4.jpg" width="410" height="274" /></b>

Marc Storace is a different kind of singer. Actually, he’s a very different kind of singer. Based in Switzerland, Storace is the singer for acclaimed hard rock band Krokus, a band that has been active since 1980.

Storace’s voice has been compared to that of Bon Scott, the original singer for the legendary AC/DC. Such is the case that he was even invited to audition when Scott passed away – and Storace, like an absolute champ, graciously refused the offer because he wanted to focus on Krokus. If that’s not dedication, we don’t know what is.
<b>Francis Ebejer</b>

<b><img class=" size-full wp-image-2391 alignright" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-5.jpg" alt="celebs 5.jpg" width="300" height="456" /></b>If you’ve never really explored Maltese literature, you might not initially think that a local author could receive international acclaim – not because Maltese literature has ever been stagnant, but because most authors, understandably, write in their mother tongue. Though Ebejer never shied away from writing in Maltese, he also had a formidable repertoire in English.

Ebejer was praised extensively for his contributions to both literature and theatre, and some of the awards he received included the Malta Literary Award, the Phoenicia Cultural Trophy, the Cheyney Award, and La Medaille d’Honneur de la Ville d’Avignon.

<h2 class="western"><span lang="it-IT">3. Del Borgo, Birgu</span></h2>

                )

            [content] => Biking in Malta does not always seem to be a popular mode of transport, and that’s pretty understandable considering that Maltese roads are usually quite busy, making biking a pretty risky option most of the time.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2475" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/bike.gif" alt="bike.gif" width="800" height="600" />
If you want to get your biking fix, though, you can go for the road less travelled and book an offroad biking activity through Fun Malta! This will let you explore all the facets of Malta that you love from unique, fresh angles.
Our offroad biking adventures come with various stops including Mdina, various wayside chapels, and even Neolithic temples. You’ll also get to see gorgeous landscapes along the way, such as cliffs and coastlines. This is what makes offroad biking more than just an athletic trip – it’s an insight into Malta’s culture, nature and history.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2478" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/bike-2.gif" alt="bike 2.gif" width="245" height="165" />

Offroad biking is available all the year round, though you will have to be prepared to combat the weather depending on the season. The worst of summer is soon coming up, so make sure that your hydration game is on point. What’s more is that people who are not used to biking (which is not actually that surprising in today’s urban culture) need not worry as there are various routes you can select and this means there are differing levels of difficulty that you can choose from.

Speaking of options, there are loads here, as you can book a half or full day and can furthermore choose whether you want to be one person, a small number of people, or a large group. Transport can be arranged to and from site, while for full day bookings a light lunch will also be provided. Prices, of course, differ depending on the selection.

                )

            [content] => We had loads of fun writing our previous article on Maltese celebrities, and that’s one of the reasons why we had to write another one (and will possibly write more in the future). The other reason is that our last article only scratched the surface of Maltese people who have a made an impressive name for themselves abroad!

This article is going to be more rooted in the music industry, so we’re going to tell you about people of various talents, from singing to composing.

<b>Destiny Chukunyere</b>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hju_YlRgUec

<b>
</b>Destiny is still in her early teenage years, but she’s quickly becoming one of Malta’s biggest stars. Destiny claimed a lot of initial fame when she won the 2015 edition of the Junior Eurovision, but prior to that she had also won the Asterisks Music Festival and SanRemo Junior.

Destiny is currently the talk of the town for singing Aretha Franklin’s ‘Think’ and passing the audition stage at Britain’s Got Talent this year, receiving a staggering 4 yeses and resounding praise from the judges!
<b></b>

<b>Kevin Borg</b>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHGhJjkrMd0

Speaking of killing it in international competitions, Kevin Borg is famous for winning the Swedish competition <i>Idol</i> in 2008. Apart from having a great voice, Borg rose to fame for being the first winner to be born outside of Sweden.

<b>Joseph Vella</b>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKfbi3tyyu8

Joseph Vella is one of Malta’s leading and innovative composers, with a substantial international following. He is known for his unique sound, mostly inspired by the neo-classical movement but with other influences seeping in, including Mediterranean sounds. Vella is known for his ability to experiment while retaining a profound sense of musicality.

<b>Nicky Bomba</b>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf65pQXqFhM

Maltese born, Australian bred multi-instrumentalist Nicky Bomba has received wide acclaim for his various musical projects including Bomba and the Melbourne Ska Orchestra, in which he is the bandleader. For many years, Bomba was also the drummer for the famous John Butler.

<b>Sandro Zerafa</b>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0qoMB0GfGA

Sandro Zerafa is the only musician on this list that specialises in jazz. The Maltese guitarist studied and made his name in France, though he has also toured on an international level. His performances and albums are certainly worth checking out if you are a jazz aficionado at all, as he certainly holds in own in the international scene.

            [content] => Summer is almost upon us, and with the changing of the seasons comes the changing of a variety of other things. You change your wardrobe, your shoe closet, your favourite hangout spots, and inevitably, your diet. The heat makes us crave fresh, salty and summery foods, foods the Maltese have been eating for years on end. So beat the heat and indulge in some traditional Maltese grub!
<h2>1. Zebbug Mimli</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BTdxwiHDa1S/?tagged=zebbugmimliamp;hl=en

A staple in every Maltese party, Holy Communion, wedding, and BBQ, these tiny, tasty stuffed goodies are a must. These go well with many other food items on this list, and embody that salty, fresh taste that we so crave in Summer. You can buy stuffed olives straight from the store, however, if you fancy a more authentic taste, <a href="http://www.ilovefood.com.mt/recipes/zebbug-mimli-stuffed-olives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try preparing them yourself</a>!
<h2>2. Ftira biz-Zejt</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BLOIh1jjDJ0/?tagged=hobzbizzejtamp;hl=en

Ah, the epitome of Maltese cuisine, one of the simplest foods packing the most intense flavours. The Hobz biz-Zejt, or Ftira biz-Zejt, has been proven to taste best by the seaside, and is the perfect snack to pack for a picnic or a day at the beach. You can really and truly assemble it any which way you like, however, the 'official' version remains <a href="http://www.malta.com/en/dining/maltese-specialities/hobz-biz-zejt-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a>.
<h2>3. Bigilla</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNFJN7WlgBE/?tagged=bigillaamp;hl=en

Bigilla can be crowned as the Official Maltese Dip, and it has quite the celebrity status on the island. Made from dried broad beans, this traditional dip is another standard BBQ appetizer, or any kind of appetizer really (you'll find Bigilla served at bars and <em>kazini </em>around the island). Readily found in most convenient stores and supermarkets, this dip is <a href="http://www.malta.com/en/dining/maltese-specialities/bigilla-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite easy to make if you're up to it</a>!
<h2>4. Bebbux</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BR0e7gxA8AE/?tagged=bebbuxamp;hl=en

Bebbux is Maltese for snails, or <em>escargots</em> in French. The Maltese dish is quite different from the French one though, traditionally served with Arjoli (a pasty goodness mainly made from tuna and anchovies) on Good Friday, or as a stew with heavenly gravy. This typical Maltese dish is the perfect side to a cold beer, thus making it perfect for summer. Try the recipe <a href="http://www.ilovefood.com.mt/uncategorized/bebbux-bl-aljoli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!
<h2>5. Gbejniet</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BS3Vftsgd7k/?tagged=gbejnaamp;hl=en

Gbejna (<em>pl. gbejniet</em>) is a typical Maltese cheese, traditionally associated with our sister island of Gozo. These small round cheeses are made from sheep's milk, and can be found in various forms: fresh (<em>gbejna friska)</em>, sun-dried, salt cured, or peppered (<em>gbejna tal-bzar</em>). These go extremely well with Hobz biz-Zejt, even though they're delicious on their own! You can find <em>gbejniet</em> at your nearest convenience store or supermarket.
<h2>6. Qaqocc Mimli</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BLR4H0wALCb/?tagged=qaqoccmimliamp;hl=en

Qaqocc mimli translates to stuffed artichokes, another must of Maltese cuisine. Each Maltese household has its own different recipe, some cutting the leaves and filling the heart, some pushing the leaves back and stuffing them with the filling - you won't find the same dish twice, but they're all mouth-wateringly exquisite. Try this recipe <a href="http://www.malta.com/en/dining/maltese-specialities/qaqocc-mimli-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and enjoy with some tasty Mediterranean salad on the side!
<h2>7. Helwa tat-Tork</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUKNflVFnTM/?tagged=helwatattorkamp;hl=en

This list could not be complete without something sweet. Helwa tat-Tork is an oriental sweet made up of tahini, almonds and vanilla. It has a texture like no other, and can be sickly sweet if consumed in abundance! The Maltese usually have this sweet with some coffee at the end of a large meal, and it is traditionally also served in parties and festivities. Although readily available in most supermarkets, <a href="http://www.ilovefood.com.mt/recipes/helwa-tat-tork-halva-%E2%80%93-turk%E2%80%99s-sweet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can try your hand at making it yourself</a>!

            [content] => Travelling with kids is quite a feat. From the very first moments of packing til the last car ride home, keeping children entertained can be somewhat difficult. That's why we have compiled a list of fun activities which you can enjoy with your kids, while on holiday in Malta! We're sure you'll find something which you and your brood will relish.
<h2>1. Kayaking</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2582" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kayaking.jpg" alt="Kayaking" width="1023" height="631" />

Being an island in the middle of one of the most gorgeous seas, Malta is a water sports playground. So it is evident that you will find a myriad of aquatic activities which are suitable for adults and also for children. Kayaking is one such sport, where you can make most of the scenery, while your kid has fun splashing around! It is also a perfect bonding sport, where you can teach your child how to row. Make the most of Malta's waters and book your kayaking/bonding session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/kayaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2587" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/p1000768p.jpg" alt="P1000768P.JPG" width="2560" height="1920" />
<h2>2. Jetfly</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-2588 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jetfly-2.jpg" alt="jetfly 2.jpg" width="1328" height="747" />

As we highlighted in our <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/05/24/jetfly-is-it-one-of-maltas-coolest-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blog post</a>, Jetflying has become a popular activity among adults and kids alike, turning all your childhood jet-pack dreams into reality. While this activity cannot be done in tandem with your child, you can take it in turns (children will be accompanied by the instructor at all times) to experience one of life's greatest thrills; propelling through the air like a cartoon character! It will surely be a memorable (and really cool!) experience for your kids - and for you too! Sign up for a jet-flying session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/jetfly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2594" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jetfly-1.png" alt="jetfly 1.png" width="694" height="521" />
<h2>3. Snorkeling</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2597" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/mg_5855untitled.jpg" alt="_MG_5855untitled.jpg" width="1199" height="745" />

Another water-based activity, snorkeling is a great way to introduce your kids to the wonders which lie just beneath the sea's surface. With a locally experienced guide to show you the best place to spot the best fish, children are sure to be entertained with this combination of swimming and discovery of a new habitat, and this can be also an introduction to Scuba Diving later on! Book your Snorkeling session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/snorkeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and explore a whole new world under the sea!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2604" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/mg_5896untitled.jpg" alt="_MG_5896untitled.jpg" width="1197" height="747" />
<h2>4. Horse Riding</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2606" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/horseriding4.jpg" alt="horseriding4.jpg" width="1440" height="810" />

If you (or your kids) prefer to try something more earth-bound, Horse Riding may be just the thing for you. This activity would be ideal for children who love animals, and can be a nice treat for adults too. Taking place in one of Malta's most beautiful locations, Golden Bay, these Horse Riding sessions offer a calm and peaceful activity amidst the beauty of nature, a truly memorable experience for you and your children. So giddy up and book your Horse Riding session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2613" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/horseriding5.jpg" alt="horseriding5.jpg" width="960" height="720" />
<h2>5. Segway Tours</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2614" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/malta-segway-tours.jpg" alt="malta-segway-tours.jpg" width="720" height="478" />

One for the older kids (children of 12 years and up can do this activity), a Segway Tour is an innovative and enjoyable way of taking in the sights and learning more about Malta. The kids will have a blast on the Segway, while the parents will get a cultural tour around Malta's most beautiful spots (and enjoy the Segway ride too, we bet!). With three fantastic routes to choose from, you'll be spoilt for choice (and keep tweens entertained), which is a win win situation! Book your tour <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2619" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/segway-dingli.jpg" alt="SEGWAY DINGLI.jpg" width="1123" height="632" /></h2>
<h2>6. SUP Yoga</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2622" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/sup-yoga-4.jpg" alt="SUP Yoga 4.jpg" width="960" height="695" />

We had explored the benefits of SUP Yoga in <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/04/07/whats-better-than-regular-yoga-sup-yoga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of our earlier posts</a>, and one of the main advantages of this fairly new activity is that it is actually a lot of fun! You and your child will be getting a good workout too, and being a water-based activity, we're sure it will be a hit with young ones. SUP Yoga can also be a great family bonding session, as there are no age or sex restrictions. Book your relaxing SUP Yoga session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/sup-yoga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and enjoy some much needed mindfulness for the whole family!

            [content] => Our dads are some of the most special persons in our lives. They give us life, they care for us in our early years (and sometimes even much later), and they give us wise and sage advice whenever we need it - sometimes even when we don't, but they always have our best intentions at heart. It is only fair that this day is dedicated to the unsung superheroes that they are, and that we give them the special treatment.
<h2>1. Spend a Day at the Beach</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVJs7ZNB8uE/?taken-at=240531053

Remember when you were just a little kid and your dad used to pack half of your belongings into the family car and take you to the beach? You can now return the favour! Surprise your dad with a planned beach day, either just you two, or with the whole family in tow. Relive some old memories and make some new ones! Your dad will surely appreciate a relaxing day by the sea, chilling with his family. Speaking of chilling, since you are now an adult, you can chill even further by sharing a beer or two with dad! (Just remember to drink responsibly, and NEVER drink and drive)

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVXvAEMDbUE/?tagged=gnejna
<h2>2. Organise a Picnic</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUY7B8BAkGC/?taken-at=250915203

Same as with beach days, your dad has spent countless days preparing for picnics and family outings in the countryside. As before, it is only proper that you return the favour. Prepare some delicious Maltese appetizers (or buy them at the supermarket if you're super busy), pack some fancy Maltese wine, a large blanket, and you're set to go! Once again, you can even invite the whole family and celebrate this special day together. Make sure to pack a football and relive old memories of kicking about and keeling over in mock pain at the slightest bruise!

<h2>3. Plan a Historical Outing</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVZEW18A4-Q/?taken-at=222667676

This one should be very simple to do - we do live in an open-air museum after all! Malta is a treasure trove of historical locations, and if your dad is somewhat of a history buff, this will surely make his day. Pick a spot (you can close your eyes and point a the Maltese map, it's <em>that</em> easy), and take your dad out for an impromptu guided tour by the man whose advice you should always follow. Your dad has been around for longer than you have, and he's bound to know some juicy secrets and lesser known facts about your favourite historical location.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BThdDK6Dl-J/?taken-at=216410480
<h2>4. Go on a Day Trip to Gozo</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVY-399FDI6/?tagged=gozo

That is, if you are from Malta. If you're Gozitan, why not plan a day trip to Malta? The point is, you can plan a day overland with your dad and maybe your lvoed ones as well. Being as limited as we are, we do not have much options when it comes to overland trips. However, our trusted sister island is always there, and makes for a perfect little day trip where you can visit new places, or re-visit old places! Admire the islands from the ferry and sample some of Gozo's famous specialities while you're there. Bonus points if you get some for back home!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVXSlB1F_0V/?tagged=gozo
<h2>5. Cook a Special Father's Day Sunday Lunch</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVCAje7hlvB/?tagged=maltesefood

Prepare a delectable Maltese dish for your dad (and maybe your whole family too) and take over the chef's apron this Sunday. Think about your dad's favourite dish, or ask your mum how to prepare his absolute favourite food, roll up your sleeve, and get to cooking! Your dad will surely appreciate the effort, and you can hone your culinary skills while donig so as well. This is also a good alternative for anyone who has not yet bought a Father's Day gift!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BUGyticB5GK/?tagged=maltesefood
<h2>6. Visit a Village Festa</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVVYig0j4Y4/?taken-at=4248039

With the Feast of St Philip coming up this Sunday, you can treat your dad to some precious festa time together! This works great if your dad is a festa enthusiast, or a fireworks enthusiast, or if he just loves to have fun. Festas are basically just big street party, and would surely be a fun way to spend Father's Day with your dad. Make sure to grab some yummy Festa food as well - we're sure your dad would appreciate some nougat for his special day!

            [content] => As sunny summer days shift into sultry nights, Malta comes alive with warm streetlights, twinkling starts spread across the sky, and the sound of energetic Maltese chatter as the whole island steps out to enjoy the cool evening air. Exploring Malta by night is probably one of the best things to do during the summer months – here are just a few favourites to help get you started on your night-time excursions!
<h1 class="western">1 | Mdina</h1>
When it comes to getting a taste of Maltese history, it doesn’t get much better than The Silent City, a beautiful walled city with sweeping views of its surrounding towns and countryside. Mdina is full of adorable little squares and hidden side streets that offer visitors an almost-constant gentle breeze. The ancient citadel was fortified by the Phoenicians around 1000 B.C., but its present name comes from the arrival of the Arabs in the 9<sup>th</sup> century, when they named the city ‘Medina’, meaning ‘walled city’. The old dry moat that once protected the city from attack was recently transformed into a public garden filled with neatly-trimmed lawns and walkways, making it the perfect place for an evening walk.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVXx0g0DBK6/
<h1 class="western">2 | Valletta</h1>
Malta’s majestic capital and the best place to be if you want to take in some stunning architecture while sipping on an ice-cold gin and tonic in one of its many buzzing bars and restaurants. Built by the Knights of St. John and named after Grand Master Jean de Vallette, Valletta is a relatively small capital city bursting with history, culture, and entertainment.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVZuH4kBpRg/
<h1 class="western">3 | Birgu</h1>
Also known by its Italian name, Citta Vittoriosa, Birgu is a magnificent fortified city with great views of Valletta and full of typically-Maltese charm. The proud city’s origins date back to the medieval period, pre-dating the dawn of Valletta’s reign as capital. Head down to the peaceful Vittoriosa Waterfront, where you’ll find a casino, the Malta Maratime Museum, and the Vittoriosa Museum to name just a few sights. Birgu is also the perfect place for a night out, with countless wine bars and restaurants waiting to be discovered among its many narrow streets.

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If soaking up the sun on a beach in Malta is not your cup of tea, look no further. Here are six fun and wholesome activities you can enjoy with  friends, family or all by your lonesome self, away from the sweltering heat of the Maltese islands.</span>Visit the Malta Aquarium
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">1. Visit the Malta Aquarium</span></h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVj2Xt3DsNX/

<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta’s one and only aquarium is located in Qawra, a coastal village situated in the north of Malta. The aquarium boasts of a variety of Mediterranean species of fish and aquamarine creatures found swimming in the Maltese coastal regions and Mediterranean sea, as well as tropical species found outside of the European seas. Expect a colourful array of sea creatures, as well as a spin on Maltese culture and history, including an exhibit of the anchor rumoured to belong to the shipwreck which brought St Paul to our island, as well as the island's Catholic faith. It is, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">however, not limited to exhibiting fish, as one may also view reptiles and amphibians. A must-see for children and all those who have a secret marine-biologist, tucked away inside of them.</span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/PQid6TEa9iIgM/giphy.webp" />
<h2>2. Escape to Scavenger Escape Rooms</h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">There’s no age limit for this one- it is as exciting for kids as it is for adults. Form a team of two to six people and head over to the Qui-Si Sana seafront in Sliema, where new adventures await you. Choose between three differently themed rooms; the Egyptian Adventure, the Mozart Mystery and the Secret Surgery rooms, all rated easy, medium and hard respectively. You have sixty minutes to crack the mystery- the sooner you figure out the puzzles, the higher the chance of breaking their records. Guaranteed to get your adrenaline pumping!</span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/q4sdF9tchap6E/giphy.webp" />
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">3. Cool off with a Ġelat</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Ġelat is a Maltese word for everyone's favourite summer (and let's be honest, winter) treat- ice-cream! Favoured by adults and kids alike, there’s nothing more refreshing than a tasty, ice-cold ice-cream. One of the best places that offers such a snack is Sotto Zero, located in Bugibba. This ice cream parlour has a wide variety of flavours available, including sugar free, vegan and lactose free options. If you don’t fancy making the trip during the day, head over to Sotto Zero for a late night treat, as they are open until the very early hours of the day. Kinder bueno ice-cream, anyone? </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/aQ0PfLFwagW52/giphy.webp" />
<h2>4. Bowling- right up your alley!</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUMHv9SFnZH/?taken-by=eden_leisure_group

<span style="font-weight:400;">Get competitive and head over to the busy town of St Julians, to Eden Superbowl, for a game of bowling with family and friends. There’s nothing like an intense game of bowling accompanied by a few drinks, or watching your kids cheer gleefully as they attempt to drop all the skittles.  And if that’s too boring for you, why not try the disco bowling feature? Available every Friday night, get lost in the game accompanied by music and cool glow in the dark effects of the lanes and the balls. Also, once you’ve worn out the game, why not head over to the arcade section for some old school arcade games? A truly fun and unforgettable experience. </span>
<h2>5. <span style="font-weight:400;">Lose yourself in St John's Co-Cathedral</span></h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVoehbFBvfJ/?taken-at=338413193

<span style="font-weight:400;">Brave the crowds of tourists in Valletta's Republic street and head over to the square, where, facing the Law Courts, you will find the visitor's entrance to what is known as one of the finest examples of high Baroque architecture in Europe. One of the many gems that the Order of Saint John gifted us, it is a full immersion into the art, history and culture that Malta's capital city has to offer. It was Grand Master Raphael Cotoner himself who ordered that the interior of the church be decorated so as to compete with Rome's finest churches, and tourists and citizens alike believe that he has succeeded. Inside the Co-Cathedral, one will find a marble floor, housing a series of tombs belonging to 400 Knights of the order, and a crypt containing the tombs of various Grand Masters, including one belonging to Valletta's name sake, Jean Parisot de Valette. Make sure to pass by The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist by Caravaggio, the most famous work of art in the church. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">6. Saunter around the Silent City by Night</span></h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVkg6YzFLQH/?taken-at=222667676

<span style="font-weight:400;">A personal favorite- this fortified city is located at the top of a hill within the Northern Region of Malta. It is said that due to it's elevated position on the island, it is always a few degrees colder than the rest of Malta, making it a must-see for those who suffer in the heat. It's equally beautiful by day, yet by night, a peaceful silence overwhelms the city. Explore the narrow side streets, enjoy the various types of cuisine it has to offer, or just admire the views in silence- you are sure to fall in love with the Medieval city. You could always book a tour through FunMalta Night Tours (follow this link-<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours</a>) and let a proffessional guide you and show you all there is to Mdina's rich history.  Bonus tip- visit the Fontanella Café for a taste of some of the most scrumptious cakes on the island, because, who doesn't love cake?</span>

            [content] => Summer in Malta is a pretty special affair, with endless sunny days and boundless blue seas wherever you turn.

Don’t worry – you can find guides who’ll teach you how to rappel down smaller, less intimidating spots. You’ll be the next Spiderman (or woman) before you know it!

Guaranteed to get you more followers! </span>
<h2>1. Sail Around our favourite sister island, Comino</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BV4UmYLlt-8/?tagged=comino

<span style="font-weight:400;">Sun, sea, and 50 shades of blue, is all you need for a fabulous snap of the tiny island of Comino. Great, for snorkeling, diving, or just for showing off your new unicorn floatie- the possibilities are endless. The island's main attraction is the Blue Lagoon, and it sure lives up to its name- its light teal shade is truly mesmerizing. And if you want to spice it up, why not charter a yacht through Fun Malta (follow the link here- </span><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/yacht-charter"><span style="font-weight:400;">https://www.funmalta.com/yacht-charter</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">) and spend your day in total luxury with family and friends. The yacht will take you around Gozo and Comino, which could only mean more snaps! #fabulous!</span>
<h2>2. <span>Pose next to our </span><i><span>other </span></i><span>Window</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Malta lost one of its most treasured natural gems; the Azure Window of Gozo. It was a sad day for the island, almost like losing a dear friend, or a family pet. </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Pd8Bf06Sas4yQ/giphy.gif" />

<span style="font-weight:400;"> This is what it looks like now- </span>

<pre><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Courtesy of Sarah Pace Warrington </span></i></pre>
<span style="font-weight:400;">However, natives were quick to point out that Gozo has yet </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">another </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">window; the Azure Window's long lost little sister- the one in Wied il-Mielaħ. </span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BR1XM6-jKCg/?tagged=gozowindow

<span style="font-weight:400;">Take advantage of the Gozo Express Tour offered by Fun Malta (follow this link- </span><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-express-tour"><span style="font-weight:400;">https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-express-tour</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">) and get your thumb moving; Gozo is full of beautiful scenery and majestic views. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">#Islandlife </span><span style="font-weight:400;">😎</span>
<h2>3. Drop by our Fishing village, Marsaxlokk</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BV4WgwDha7d/?tagged=malta

<span style="font-weight:400;">Marsaxlokk is Malta's traditional fishing village; the village’s name comes from </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">marsa</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, which means "port" and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">xlokk</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, which is the local name for south east. Join the "Xlukkajri" at the Marsaxlokk Market, a large mark which takes place around the entire village on Sundays, or visit the tourist market any day of the week, or just absorb the sea air and the colourful "luzzu" boats, a symbol of Malta's fishing trade. #bythesea </span><span style="font-weight:400;">⛵</span>
<h2>4. Stroll around the Upper Barrakka Gardens</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BTWdoESAA0Y/?taken-by=sarah.p.w
<pre><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Courtesy of Sarah Pace Warrington </span></i></pre>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you happen to be in Valletta, walk to the Upper Barrakka Gardens for a spectacular view of the Grand Harbour, one of Malta's finest sites. The gardens are located on the upper tier of the Saint Peter and Paul bastion. The lower tier contains the Saluting Battery. In the park, one will find several monuments or memorials depicting several historical figures, such as Gerald Strickland, Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Thomas Maitland. There is also a replica statue of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Les Gavroches, </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">created by Antonio Sciortino, one of Malta's finest sculptors. #cultural </span><span style="font-weight:400;">🤓</span>
<h2>5. Snap our Sea views</h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Roam around Sliema's promenade, and catch a glimpse of Valletta's seafront, and its medieval, traditional architecture. There's nothing more picturesque than the seafront during sunset:-</span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVjpyHMAgyg/?taken-by=sarah.p.w
<pre><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Courtesy of Sarah Pace Warrington </span></i></pre>
<span style="font-weight:400;">And, if you like a more modern view, switch it up! Go to Valletta and take a photograph of Sliema's seafront. The contrast is uncanny; it is urban and almost  futuristic, in comparison to Valletta. </span>

<h2>6. Admire the heights of Dingli Cliffs</h2>
Scared of heights?

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/QG0XQms55iOpa/giphy.gif" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Get over your fear with a good selfie. Visit Dingli Cliffs, situated in Dingli, in the Nothern Region of the Maltese Islands. The cliffs are situated at one of the highest points of the island, some 250 meters above sea level. The cliffs provide open sea views and a glimpse at the isle of Filfa, an uninhabited rock along the coast. One can also spot the Buskett Gardens and Verdala Palace, but also areas of garrigue land. Perfect for a picnic, or just drive by to admire the view. #fearofheightsconquered </span><span style="font-weight:400;">😎</span>

<h2>7.  Soak in the Sand, Sun and Sea at Għajn Tuffieħa</h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Time to take that well deserved break; put on your swimming garb, sunglasses and flip flops and head down to Għajn Tuffieħa. Forming part of Manikata village, it is an area in Mellieħa that is home to three popular bays- Għajn Tuffieħa, Golden Bay and Ġnejna. This particular bay is distinct, as before you actually get to the beach, you have to descend 200 steps (and if you're going down 200 steps, at some point, you have to climb up 200 steps). Yet do not be discouraged, as the cold, crystal clear sea and the red sands are worth the trip! Barbecues are allowed on this beach, so make an evening out of it! #seasunandfood </span><span style="font-weight:400;">🍔</span>

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">The island of Malta is rich in history, culture and tradition- elements which are found at the heart of every typical Maltese village, no less the tranquil village of Mellieħa. Mellieħa is a village situated on a hill, in the Northern region of Malta, and it is known for being one of the most tourist-friendly areas on the island. It is home to beaches, hotels, resorts and restaurants alike. This village has remained authentically and charmingly Maltese throughout the years, one can admire the hustle and bustle of the everyday life of the Mellieħa villagers, despite the large population of tourists residing in the area. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">The name "Mellieħa" comes from the Maltese word "melħ", which in turn means salt. It is names after the ancient Roman salt pans found in Mellieħa Bay. However, this site is now occupied by the Għadira Nature Reserve; a bird sanctuary which temporarily homes over of 140 species of migrating birds which visit annually.  </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">It is a historically sacred village, as the area has been inhabited since the Neolithic times. One can spot several caves in the area, as well as tombs, and it is also home to the temple of Għajn Żejtuna, found closer to the coast. In addition, it is said that when St. Paul was shipwrecked in Malta, St. Luke, who was with St. Paul at the time, whilst exploring his surroundings, found himself in one of Mellieħa's caves and painted the figure of the Madonna on one of the cave's walls. Thus, this cave became a church, and  it has since been known as the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieħa. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">The sandy beaches are a definite attraction in this small town- Għadira is one of the most popular beaches in Malta, loved by locals and tourists alike. This is probably because of its vast area, consisting of a total of three beaches, separated by rocky areas, ideal for those who despise the sand. It has been awarded the Blue Flag Status, due to the fact that its waters are some of the cleanest in the island, and visibly so! The water is crystal clear, which is a definite advantage when it comes to spotting jellyfish. The beach ranges from shallow waters, providing safety for the kids, to deeper seas, great for snorkeling adventures.  The beach is laden with quality restaurants, kiosks, sunbeds and umbrellas, and all the amenities one might need to enjoy a relaxing day by the beach with family and friends. There are also lifeguards on site, making it one of the safest beaches on the island. Apart from Għadira, Mellieħa is also home to many other beaches: Paradise Bay, Armier and Little Armier, Golden Bay, Għajn Tuffieħa, Slugs Bay, and also Imġiebaħ Bay. The choices are endless!</span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWb9q6plysR/?taken-at=236259451

<span style="font-weight:400;">St. Agatha's Tower, or better known as The Red Tower, is visible from Għadira bay, due to its vibrant red colour. The watchtower's main purpose was to be used as a signalling post for communication between Malta and Gozo, and in the past, it was capable of housing over thirty soldiers. A visit is surely required, as the top of the tower offers spectacular views of the Mellieħa countryside, the beaches and can even offer a peak at Gozo. St. Agatha's tower was the last large bastioned tower to be built in the Maltese islands. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Another great feature of Mellieħa is Popeye Village, a filmset used in the 1980's Popeye movie, starring Robin Williams, that was kept after the production of the film ended. It has since become an entertainment park, great for an afternoon for families. It also offers all the facilities needed to make a day out of your visit- an on-site restaurant, beach facilities to swim in Anchor Bay, re-enactments by actors dressed up as Popeye characters and even a cinema!</span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWbBNpSl5tV/?taken-at=236259451

<span style="font-weight:400;">Naturally this village offers so much more- renowned restaurants, bars, pubs and karaoke bars, parks, gardens and even museums. It is a village that is treasured by all, and it is one which is worth the visit, and the stay.

<h2><b>1. New York Best</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Situated in three locations: Msida, Paceville and Sliema, this place is hard to miss. Their menu is extensive to say the least; from breakfasts, to salads and wraps, to the more sinful varieties such as pizza and burgers, this place does it all. Their burgers are a force to be reckoned with- ranging from meats, to buttermilk chicken, all the way to veggie and falafel burgers, all served in a super soft brioche bun. This place will definitely satisfy your cravings! The restaurant is run by the Diacono brothers; self-professed foodies to the core. They vow to pay particular attention to using the best ingredients and to the detail in their food. And as their motto says; there's always time for New York Best!</span>

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If you're on holiday in Malta, and you fancy a holiday within a holiday, look no further. Fun Malta offers you the Sicily Tour, a one day trip of a lifetime. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Sicily happens to be the largest island within the Mediterranean Sea,  surrounded by other smaller  yet equally beautiful islands. It is home to Mount Etna, Europe’s tallest active volcano, at 3,329 m (10,922 ft) high.  This captivating island offers its tourists the best experience an island can offer, panoramic beaches, immeasurable landscapes, a mild climate and a cuisine which is to die for. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">When touring with Fun Malta, one can choose between two types of tours- the Taormina and Mount Etna One Day Tour, and a relaxing Culture, History and Gastronomic Tour.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2890" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/italy-taormina-sicilian-market-italian-sicily-2476286.jpg" alt="Italy-Taormina-Sicilian-Market-Italian-Sicily-2476286.jpg" width="960" height="704" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">The first Tour option will take you for a visit to “Il Comune di Taormina”, a municipality in the city of Messina, found on the side of a mountain, guaranteed to offer its visitors a “dolce vita” experience. It is the perfect location for a relaxing, carefree holiday, as the area is laden with restaurants, cafe’s, beaches and boutiques- a perfect getaway from the busy everyday life. It is home to the “Teatro Greco”, a horse-shoe shaped Greek Theatre built in 300 BC, and it is the second largest Greek Theatre in Sicily. It sometimes hosts international arts and film exhibitions. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2892" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maxpixel-freegreatpicture-com-mediterranean-italy-sicily-historic-architecture-2223066.jpg" alt="MaxPixel.freegreatpicture.com-Mediterranean-Italy-Sicily-Historic-Architecture-2223066.jpg" width="1920" height="709" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">The Taormina and Mount Etna tour will also take you to Corso Umberto, the main street of Taormina, a pedestrian zone filled with boutiques and culture. One may visit Piazza IX Aprile, which offers magnificent views and its very own Chiesa San Giuseppe. There's also the famous Torre dell'Orologio, a 12</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> century clock-tower, which leads to Piazza del Duomo, where one can admire a fountain, dated back to 1635, that exhibits the symbol of Taormina; a centaur with the bust of an angel. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2894" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maxpixel-freegreatpicture-com-flowers-piazza-checkerboard-taormina-square-italy-2059115.jpg" alt="MaxPixel.freegreatpicture.com-Flowers-Piazza-Checkerboard-Taormina-Square-Italy-2059115.jpg" width="1920" height="1324" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">To conclude the day with a bang, the tour will take you through a climb to Mount Etna, guaranteeing panoramic views of villages, forests, the local agriculture, vineyards and orchards, ultimately leading to the volcanic plains of Mount Etna. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2896" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/etna-140103_1920.jpg" alt="etna-140103_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1440" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">The Culture, History and Gastronomic Tour is an entirely different experience altogether, yet one will find that it is just as wonderful. Ideal for all history aficionados, this tour will guide you through the three ancient cities of Noto, Marzamemi and Syracuse. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2898" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maxpixel-freegreatpicture-com-church-baroque-cathedral-sicily-noto-italy-1912944.jpg" alt="MaxPixel.freegreatpicture.com-Church-Baroque-Cathedral-Sicily-Noto-Italy-1912944.jpg" width="1920" height="1280" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Noto is a city close to Syracuse, home to the Noto Cathedral, a church which has been declared to be a UNESCO World Heritage site. The entire city is a fine example of the Sicilian Baroque architectural style. On the other hand, Marzamemi is a seas-side village known for its fishing culture, mainly the tuna-fishing variety. It is also known for its artisanal produce, namely dried or canned tuna, smoked fish, marinated anchovies and condiments- a seafood lover's dream! It is also conveniently nearby to the sandy beach of Porto Palo di Capo Passero. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2900" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/nun-643167_1920.jpg" alt="nun-643167_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1276" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Finally, this tour will end in Syracuse, a city which is bursting with Greek history, cultures, amphitheaters and architecture, including the Temple of Apollo, the Fountain of Arethusa and its very own Greek Theatre. It is also the birthplace of the acclaimed mathematician and engineer Archimedes. This city is also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its fundamentally rich history. One will also be able to experience an inclusive traditional Sicilian lunch, to get a real sense of what it is like to be Sicilian. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">It is truly hard to choose between both tours, but whichever you end up choosing, the ultimate Sicilian experience is definitely guaranteed.

            [content] => What is it about a Maltese summer that has thousands of tourists and travellers flocking to this side of the Mediterranean each year? Some visitors love our sun-kissed island so much, they never leave and decide to make Malta or Gozo their permanent home! So let’s take a cheeky look at just 7 top reasons to make Malta you summer destination:
<h2><b>1 | Serious Summer Weather</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you’re looking for days drenched in golden sunshine, then Malta’s definitely the place to be. With  around eight months of sunshine a year, you’ll be going back home with the most enviable of tans! Remember to take care of your skin and drink lots of water, because the UV index can get a little high over here, and the last thing you want to do is end up looking like a lobster. </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/l3nF87iGPgxHV0oWA/giphy.webp" />
<h2><b>2 | Beautiful Beaches</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">With all that glorious sun, you </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">know </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">we need some equally-excellent beaches, right? You’ll never be far from the sea, so take your pick - sandy or rocky, north, central, or south, we’ve got a pretty good selection in store for you. </span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWs9wiVBh6Y/
<h2><b>3 | Ridiculously Rich History</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The Maltese Islands saw their first settlers around 5200 BC, when stone age farmers and hunters came over from Sicily. Since then, a </span><b>lot </b><span style="font-weight:400;">has happened on these tiny islands; from the awe-inspiring Megalithic temples, to Phoenician, Roman, Arabic, Byzantine, Norman, French, and British rule and beyond! If you love being immersed in century upon century of history, look no further. </span>

<h2><b>4 | Gorgeous Gozo</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">No trip to Malta can ever be complete without spending at least one day on our sister island, Gozo! With a typically-Mediterranean vibe and breath-taking sights to see, you’ll be charmed in an instant. </span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWpL_Sbg8ea/?taken-at=246549639
<h2><b>5 | Buzzing Nightlife</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta’s two entertainment hotspots, St. Julian’s and Paceville, as bursting with all the clubs, pubs, lounges, and restaurants you could need during your time here. For something little more laid back, hit Valletta and enjoy a night out surrounded by our capital’s regal beauty! </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/wAxlCmeX1ri1y/giphy.webp" />
<h2><b>6 | English is Everywhere</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Almost every Maltese person alive can speak three languages: English, Maltese, and Italian. That means you probably don’t need to worry about any language barriers, but when in doubt - talk with your hands, just like the locals! </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/l2YWmJXKo7imjqhxu/giphy.webp" />
<h2><b>7 | Endless Fun</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta may be small in size, but it’s BIG on fun. You’ll always have something new and exciting to do, from <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scuba diving</a> and <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cruising around Comino</a> to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horse riding</a>, <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/kayaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kayaking</a>, and more!  </span>

            [content] => <span lang="en-US">Valletta, or ‘Il-Belt’ (The City), is loved by locals and tourists alike - but what makes this great walled city so popular? A quick look online will reward you with countless photos showing off our capital city’s incredible beauty, but let’s take a closer look at why so many people want to make Valletta their home!</span>
<h2>1. Stunning Architecture</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BMr8BXEAybN/?taken-by=arguablykelly
<span lang="en-US">Living in Valletta means being treated to beautiful buildings and little architectural quirks are every turn. Described as an ‘architectural jewel’, the 2018 European Capital of Culture is a living treasure chest filled with majestic baroque buildings, imposing fortifications built by the Knights of St. John, and enchanting churches, to name just a few highlights.</span>

<h2>2. Entertainment Haven</h2>

<span lang="en-US">You’ll never be short of something to do here - whether you’re in the mood for some fine dining or just want to enjoy an aperitif with your besties, you’re sure to find something to suit you.

<h2>3. Drama Central</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BAVWHnqrbP3/?tagged=teatrumanoel
<span lang="en-US">We mean theatre, of course! Valletta is home to the Manoel Theatre, the Royal Opera House (in ruins, recently converted into an open-air venue), and St. James Cavalier, a creative space where you can enjoy art exhibitions, less mainstream films, and live-streamed performance from the Royal Shakespeare Company, for example. If you love the arts, this is definitely the city for you. </span>

<h2>4. Stunning Views</h2>
<span lang="en-US">A view of Valletta’s sweeping skyline is pretty tough to beat, day or night! That being said, you’ll find loads of gorgeous scenery all over the city. Our favourite view right now has to be the Grand Harbour, seen from the Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens!</span>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvEnfwAdIp/
<h2>5. Centuries of History</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUferUrh41c/
<span lang="en-US">Around 1524, the Knights of the Order of St. John were proposed that a city should be built on the strategically-positioned Sciberras Peninsula. It was Grand Master Jean de Valette who gave the city its name and overall plan, and the rest is (literally) history! The city is alive with century upon century of history, from the opulent auberges and churches to its regal bastions, enduring fortifications, and beyond - you’ll find yourself falling in love with the place you call home every day.</span>

            [content] => Comino is Malta and Gozo's (little) sister island, situated right in between both islands, and being 3.5 square kilometers in area, she sure is tiny. However, she is none the less beautiful, some even preferring her to her sisters. Below are six reasons why you should <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book a Comino and Blue Lagoon Cruise with Fun Malta</a>, today!
<h2>1. It is almost uninhabited</h2>
Fun fact: the island of Comino is home to only three residents, the fourth having passed away in 2017, making it virtually uninhabited. This gives you ample space to explore the island on foot or on bike; the garrigue wilderness, the rocky cliffs, all the beaches and caves that the island has to offer. You will notice that it is a totally different atmosphere from Malta and Gozo's- there's a minimal amount of cars, buildings or anything in between, and the entire island is a protected nature reserve and bird sanctuary, making it a welcome change from the hectic everyday life of Malta.

<h2>2. The Blue Lagoon</h2>
This is Comino's main attraction- a teal stretch of water connecting Comino with Cominotto. The waters are clear and the sand is white- a beautiful background for a relaxing day by the sea. Swimming to Cominotto is easy and manageable, if not totally enjoyable. There is a kiosk, facilities, sunbeds and umbrellas available for rent at the beach. However, the beach gets busy during the better part of the day, making <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fun Malta's Comino and Blue Lagoon Cruises</a> ideal- you can lie on the beach or stay on the boat, which will be anchored at the bay, therefore all facilities, including food and drink, showers and air-conditioned areas are available to all guests.

<h2>3. It is great for Snorkeling</h2>
The warm, clear water and the secluded cloves make the waters of Comino the perfect place for snorkeling amateurs and professionals alike. The area around the Blue Lagoon is full of underwater caves, rich in marine life, making it an unforgettable experience. Cominotto and its surrounding areas are also home to a coral reef, whilst the Santa Marija Cave is laden with shoals of bream, however, for this particular activity, one must organise an excursion with a diving centre in Malta or Gozo, as it is not accessible by land.

<h2>4. St Mary's Tower</h2>
This tower is the most prominent feature of the island, being the easiest to spot from a distance. The story behind this tower is interesting enough to warrant a visit; in 1416, the Maltese people petitioned their king at the time, Alfonso V of Aragon, to serve as a warning system against the Turks, pirates and corsairs who had taken to hiding in Comino and using the ground to attack the other islands. The King agreed, thus he raised taxes on wine to raise the funds for the tower, however, he decided to keep the money for himself, thus leaving the island undefended. It was the Knights of Malta, or more specifically, Grandmaster Wignacourt, who finally made the Maltese citizen's wishes come true, two hundred years later.

<h2>5. Comino is almost a Celebrity</h2>
The island, with all its fine scenery and shades of blue, was used in popular movies like Troy, The Count of Monte Cristo and Swept Away.  This comes as no surprise- the island is peaceful, unencumbered and untouched by the building frenzy, making it the perfect setting for any Roman, Medieval or your typical "stranded on an island" movie. So follow the likes of Brad Pitt, Guy Pearce and even Madonna, and visit this magical island.

Although neighbouring, both towns serve different purposes- whilst Sliema showcases the "dolce vita", with leisure activities such as beaches, shopping, cafés, and sea views, St. Julians is a vibrant burst of party life, bars and restaurants, making the fact that they are so closely connected an advantage to locals and tourists alike. Talk about having the best of both worlds!

Start your day the Maltese way- have a "te' u pastizzi" (tea and pastizzi- almost a Maltese delicacy) at Giorgio's café, overlooking the Sliema Ferries. Giorgio's is one of the first cafés to ever grace the town of Sliema, therefore it is only fitting that one should start their day there! It is found right at the corner of Bisazza street, a pedestrian street full of shops and boutiques, yet it boasts of excellent views of the coming and goings of the ferries and <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harbour cruises</a> available at Sliema Ferries. It is the perfect way to observe the hustle and bustle of Sliema, as although the town's namesake means "peace", it happens to be one of Malta's busiest towns.

Spend the rest of the morning at the beach- Sliema, being a coastal town, boasts of a variety of clean yet rocky beaches, with sunny and shaded areas alike, along the sea front. Some notable swimming areas are Tigne, Surfside, Exiles and Qui-Si Sana- all safe, clean and equipped with ladders, with flat areas ideal for sunbathing. You could also opt to take a <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harbour cruise around Sliema and Valletta</a>- a great experience for all the family.

For lunch, the options in Sliema are endless, and able to suit every individual's needs. For those who are health conscious, yet won't compromise their tastebuds' enjoyment, Mint (opposite Surfside) is the ideal option- boasting of freshly prepared, vegetable based, vegetarian or vegan dishes. If you're in the mood for some typical Maltese cuisine, head over to Ta' Kris, a tiny yet charming restaurant that will definitely impress. If you are looking for lunch on a budget, look for Il-Gabbana, a café located on the Sliema Waterfront, opposite Surfside, or Tony's Bar, a British pub style café opposite the Sliema Ferries.

If you want to avoid the harsh sun in the afternoon, make your way towards The Point, Sliema's largest shopping mall, for some shopping and relaxation. For those who like to shop, The Point offers many different stores, from high end, to high street- your needs and wants are very likely to be met! One will find clothing stores, make up stores, shoe stores, perfumeries, "tech" shops, sport shops, a kitchenwear store... the list is endless! And if shopping really, really, <i>really </i>isn't your thing, head over to JAR, ground level, for the best milkshake of your life.

Of. Your. Life.

In the evening, it's a no-brainer; the only place to go to is St. Julians. If the weather permits/ if you have enough energy after such a long day of bliss and relaxation, you can walk to St, Julians following the Sliema seafront. If not, buses are readily available, with a bus stop within walking distance from anywhere you are currently situated in Sliema. St. Julians, in the evening, is colourful and vibrant- there will always be something to do, somewhere to go or something to see.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXRDrQDgdhq/?taken-at=3798792

St. Julians is home to Paceville, a party village overflowing with clubs, bars and restaurants. If you are feeling adventurous, start your evening with happy hour from Soho lounge, situated at the heart of Paceville. If, however, you are looking for quiet, quality fine dining, look no further than Caviar and Bull- a nationally and internationally renowned restaurant. Alternatively, if you cannot get enough of Maltese cuisine, head over to Gululu, located by the waterfront of St Julians.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BV8tKhUhN19/?taken-at=946043354

If you are still wild at heart, it is now time to club. Grab your friends and walk over to Havana club, the home of Ramp;B, or Bar Native, for some Latin music. The choices are vast and endless, see where the night takes you!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWv7ConjIj0/?taken-at=222911417

After a day like this, it is hard not to go back to these towns. There are so many things to do in both Sliema and St. Julians, that if you <i>do </i>decide to go back, the experience will always be most satisfying.

            [content] => Malta’s sister island, Gozo, is so beautiful that Maltesers and tourists alike love to escape there for weekend breaks or day trips to enjoy its idyllic beaches and laid-back vibe. No trip to Malta is complete without spending at least a day in Gozo, so here are just 6 things to help get you started on your Gozitan adventure!
<h2><b>1 | Swim at Ramla l-Hamra</b></h2>
Ramla l-Hamra (‘The Red Sandy Beach’) is a gorgeous stretch of beach located on the north-eastern side of the island. Be sure to take an umbrella and layer on the sun block, because you won’t want to leave this slice of paradise.

<h2><b>2 | Eat (and drink) Well </b></h2>
Gozo may be even smaller than Malta, but make no mistake - it’s BIG on food. We could list loads of must-try restaurants and eateries dotted around the island, but here are a few top picks that’ll have you covered when you get hungry: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tmunmgarr/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It-Tmun</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/tmunmgarr/?ref=br_rs -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/162669017117957/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ta’ Karolina</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/groups/162669017117957/?ref=br_rs -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MaxokkBakery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxokk</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/MaxokkBakery/ -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/countryterraceGozo/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Country Terrace</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/countryterraceGozo/?ref=br_rs -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lastanzarestaurant/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Stanza</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/lastanzarestaurant/?ref=br_rs  -->, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Boathouse-Group-604438609588106/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Boat House</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/The-Boathouse-Group-604438609588106/?ref=br_rs -->.

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"> </span>
<h2><b>3 | Visit Ta’ Pinu</b></h2>
Known to locals simply as ‘Ta’ Pinu’, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Blessed Virgin of Ta’ Pinu (say that fast, ten times) is an enchanting minor basilica and shrine that becomes all the more magical around sunset.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BSJs5VkjzxV/?taken-at=883610519
<h2><b>4 | Snap some photos around Dwejra </b></h2>
Even without the awe-inspiring Azure Window standing tall, Dwejra is still totally worth a visit! Take in the rugged landscapes and watch the waves roll against the time-worn rocks before you walk down to enjoy a drink at one of the quaint, colourful little bars by the inland sea.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWnYLjKAIPf/?taken-at=254920783
<h2><b>5 | Take a Jeep Tour </b></h2>
If you want to see as much as possible in one action-packed day, then why not take a <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-jeep-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jeep tour of Gozo</a><!-- Link to funmalta jeep tour  -->? This is probably the best and most effective way to discover some of the island’s most breath-taking sights, with plenty of time to snap as many photos as you like.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXijYByAVCc/?taken-at=246549639
<h2><b>6 | Wander around Cittadella </b></h2>
The Cittadella is a regal walled city that watches over Victoria and offers some truly unbeatable views. Walk through the city gate and step back in time as you explore this gorgeous piece of Gozitan history, and end your visit with a chilled drink at Café San Martino.

            [content] => Summer in Malta is known for a multitude of things- beaches, concerts, <i>unbearable </i>heat (I’m talking about you, heatwave ‘Lucifer’), but among the locals, summer usually indicates one thing- village festas. They are held on particular dates between the months of May and September. Love them or hate them, they happen; fireworks, festoons, flags, petards, all for the celebration of the village’s patron saint.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXKzZIHDQlT/?tagged=maltafesta

Each festa is usually held around the perimeters of the parish church of the village. The streets are decorated with columns, festoons, lights and flags, hung upon the houses that surround the parish church. The food stalls sell traditional Maltese nougat, <i>mqaret</i> (fried date cakes) and <i>those </i>amazingly oily sweet jam donuts “tal-festa”.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xGNYX8nPHc90I/giphy.gif" alt=" movie crying god mindy kaling donut GIF" />

Much needed cold beer is passed around from the outside bars found on the edge of the street, and paper mache statues that join the crowds, as hundreds of villagers swarm the area as the festivities begin. The local <i>banda, </i>a village band, competes with the sounds of the fireworks bursting into colourful displays. The band performs local favourites, and everyone sings along, whilst the crowd follows the band around the streets of the village, spreading the cheer.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXnwQqbFl3m/?tagged=maltafesta

The local celebrity eventually comes out to meet the crowds- that is, the ginormous statue of the patron saint, that a chosen number of people carry on their backs, whilst the adoring crowd cheers them on. After that, an exhibition of the <i>ġigġifogu, </i>or pinwheels, mesmerizes the crowds, crowning the end of the street festa. After parties are usually held at the local bar, or <i>każin. </i>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BJRESqmhX4g/?tagged=maltafesta

Funnily enough, some Maltese festas carry the same name, even though they are held in different villages. This is because different villages sometimes have the same patron saint. This is also where some villagers get competitive with others, constantly bickering about which festa is the most elaborate and spectacular, due to how dedicated and passionate they are about their village feast. In August alone, there are 11 Feasts of the Assumption of our Lady, celebrated in Mqabba (13th-15th of August), Victoria (Gozo) (15th August), Qrendi (15th August), Mosta (15th August), Gudja (15th August), Ħal-Ghaxaq (15th August), Attard (15th August), Ħad-Dingli (15th August), Mġarr (18th August) and Żebbuġ (Gozo) (18th August). There are so many happening within the span of a week, so take your pick!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BW3G1VoFJWI/?tagged=maltafesta

Some great feasts to follow are the Feast of Stella Maris, which is held in Sliema on the 18th till the 20th of August, the Feast of St, Dominic in Birgu, held on the 25th till the 27th of August, and the Feast of St Julian, held on the 25th till the 27th of August. The festas drag on for three days, therefore, when different festas occur on the same day, it is more than possible to visit a different village festa each day.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXBWRGjAekF/?tagged=maltafesta

In September, the festivities continue. On the 1st of September, until the 4th, Sliema will be celebrating the Feast of St Gregory, whilst Żurrieq will be celebrating the Feast of St. Catherine. It is highly recommended that you visit Mellieħa for the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lady and “Il- Vitorja”, throughout the week of the 1st of September to the 8th of September, where the two Mellieħa band clubs, the Imperial band club and La Vittoria Philharmonic society, will be marching along the streets of Mellieħa. All the local restaurants are open, shows and parades are held in the streets, and the firework displays across the Mellieħa landscapes are a sight to behold.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXWBmvXBXFM/?tagged=maltafesta

Take an opportunity to really integrate with the village locals, and celebrate their most anticipated day of the year with them, as some cherish their village festa more than their actual birthday! It is an experience not to be missed, and integral part of what it really means to be Maltese.

Staying active doesn’t have to be a chore – here are just a few of our favourite ways to get moving while you explore Malta and make the most out of your day!

<h2 style="text-align:left;"><b>1. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/sup-yoga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUP Yoga</a></b></h2>
<a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/04/07/whats-better-than-regular-yoga-sup-yoga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stand Up Paddling meets Yoga!</a> You’ll work on your balance, breathing, strength, and flexibility while floating on idyllic Mediterranean waters. When things start getting a little too warm, just ‘fall’ into the sea and cool off. SUP Yoga is definitely the right kind of summertime activity to try with friends – if not just for the laughs you’ll have!

            [content] => Magic is something that was ever-present in our childhood, but less so in our adulthood. From Disney movies, to television series like Bewitched, and finally, Harry Potter- who hasn’t been mesmerized by the idea of magic?

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pI2paNxecnUNW/giphy.gif" alt=" harry potter magic hermione granger ronald weasley hprewatch GIF" />

Magic has been around for centuries, it is known as one of the oldest and most sought-after genres of performing arts in history, where audiences were entertained for hours by card tricks, optical illusions and well-staged rituals. By time, the tricks performed became more elaborate- from pulling a rabbit out of a hat (nonetheless a classic, in my opinion), to escaping from a set of handcuffs whilst trapped in a tank full of water (The Prestige, anyone?).

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6enFRY6UGLpJe/giphy.gif" alt=" movie christian bale christopher nolan the prestige GIF" />

Luckily for all of us dreamers, magic is still very much alive in 2017, and can be found in Malta! Bring your friends and family to the notorious Chamber of Mysteries in the heart of Malta, Qormi. The venue is a traditional Maltese farmhouse called Razzett l-Antik (the old farmhouse), built by the Knights of St John in 1743, the ideal venue to give you that traditional Maltese feeling. It is said to be the secret venue where old wizards used to meet in the past, to perform their magical rituals, hence the name “Chamber of Mysteries”. However, the main building was once utilised as a milling factory, which is why Razzett l-Antik is dedicated to the best Maltese cuisine can offer.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohfFr0PcMTsonsgb6/giphy.gif" alt="Twin Peaks on Showtime season 1 episode 5 twin peaks showtime GIF" />

The night consists of an all-inclusive buffet dinner, featuring purely traditional Maltese cuisine, free-flowing wine, soft-drinks and water, and the highlight of the evening- a magic show featuring the award-winning magician Brian Role’, accompanied by the beautiful and talented Lola Palmer. Get ready for a night of mind-blowing magical illusions, levitation, mind-reading acts, and even floating objects, accompanied by some witty humour and performances that defy all logical explanations- the true art of magic. </span>

<h3></h3>
<h3><b>1. Żmerc, Attard</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This bar is an absolute favourite of all; those who have only just discovered alcohol (legally) and those who are older and wiser, who only come down for a pint or two with friends. Its versatility, combined with a friendly, enthusiastic atmosphere, makes for the perfect “change of scenery” from the bars and clubs of Paceville. In addition, this bar provides nibbles on the house and a full menu for the hungrier clientele, which is always a bonus when out drinking! </span>

<h3><b>2. City Bar, Mosta</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Found in the heart of Mosta, this casual “każin” (maltese bar) style bar is adored by locals and outsiders alike due to its cosy, charming and traditionally Maltese aura. Dimly lit and respectfully quiet, this place is perfect for those winter nights when the craving for something strong to warm you up is ever-present. Great for group outings or romantic wine dates, this place also offers platters and meals, to keep that sobriety going. </span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BTe_6_gFB7h/?tagged=delborgo

<span style="font-weight:400;">This gem of a bar is hidden in the lonely streets of Birgu (Citta’ Vittoriosa), one of the Three Cities. Yet don’t be fooled by the antiquity and silence this beauty of a town has to offer, as the fun begins and ends in Del Borgo. Set in a traditionally Maltese “house of character”, the atmosphere in this bar encourages you to drink and relax, whilst the exquisite menu entices you to order almost everything they have to offer. If a heavy meal is not what you’re looking for, platters made to perfectly accompany your wine are available. A true hidden treasure!</span>
<h3><b>4. The Fortress, Xemxija </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Overlooking the Xemxija and St. Paul’s bay, this place is the perfect summer hangout. Perfect for a day of drinking with colleagues or a romantic evening with the significant other, The Fortress Wine and Dine will definitely fulfil all your alcoholic expectations. Bonus: the platters are international and PLENTIFUL, so ready your bellies before ordering! </span>

<h3><b>5. StrEAT  Whiskey amp; Bistro, Valletta</b></h3>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BU7DMphgELR/?taken-by=streatwhisky

<span style="font-weight:400;">This is the perfect excuse to visit our capital city (just in case you actually </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">need </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">an excuse to go to Valletta), this bar can be found in one of Valletta’s many narrow side roads, particularly in this case, Strada Stretta (Strait Street). This road is famously known for its history as the epitome of Maltese nightlife back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where British and American militants mingled and co-existed with the Maltese frequenters. If you feel the need to keep this tradition alive, head over to StrEAT (yes, with a capital EAT, as it should be), for a whisky, a bottle of wine and a platter. The nostalgic atmosphere will certainly encourage you to return! </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/uYcuStWfBtHnW/giphy.gif" alt=" tv wine megan mullally karen walker will grace GIF" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Having said all the above (and almost encouraged our dear readers to get intoxicated this weekend), please drink and drive responsibly. Assign a designated driver, travel by bus or taxi, or stick to the threshold designed by Maltese law (0.8mg of alcohol per ml of blood or 35mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath). Either way, enjoy responsibly! </span>

            [content] => The Three Cities are known individually as Cospicua, Senglea and Vittoriosa, yet locals known them by other names; “Bormla”, “l-Isla” and “il-Birgu”, respectively. These cities have, in time, settled into quiet traditionally authentic Maltese villages, yet in the past they were not only regarded as homes, but as crucial fortresses of the island, to almost all the natives at the time.

These harbours have been in use since Phoenician times, providing the locals with work and opportunities to trade, yet they left the villagers vulnerable in times of war. However, when the Order of St. John first arrived in Malta, they took the Three Cities under their wing and fortified them, whilst building the palaces and churches that are still standing to this day, giving the cities their grandiose and classical feel. Since the Order settled within the Three Cities before moving onto Valletta, we can say that they are older than the capital city itself.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3210" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/malta-1910173_960_720.jpg" alt="malta-1910173_960_720.jpg" width="960" height="640" />

Out of all three cities, Birgu happens to be the oldest, as its activity dates back to the Middle Ages; any ruler hoping to obtain leadership of Malta had to first conquer Birgu due to its crucial position in the Grand Harbour. It is found in the Southeastern region of Malta, with Fort Saint Angelo at its head. The city boasts of a very long history with maritime, mercantile and military activities. Once the Order of St. John arrived in Malta, Birgu was made capital city of the island, and Mdina was removed of its title, due to the fact that Mdina was not a harbour city, therefore could not suit the Order’s naval needs.

Birgu was in the spotlight during the Great Siege of 1565, and due to the Knights’ newly built fortresses and defence tactics, Malta was not conquered by the Ottoman Empire. This victory is what inspired Birgu’s title, “Citta’ Vittoriosa”. Unfortunately, Birgu was heavily bombed during World War II, due to its proximity to the Malta Dockyard, and a number of historical buildings emanating from the era of the Knights were destroyed, including the Birgu Clock Tower.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3212 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/flag-116590_960_720.jpg" alt="flag-116590_960_720" width="960" height="720" />

Nowadays, Birgu is growing in popularity, due to its quiet disposition and the Birgufest, which is takes place in October. During Birgufest, the city is lit by candlelight, to enhance the historic and architectural beauty of the city.

Senglea, or rather, “l-Isla”, is Birgu’s fortified neighbour, and is also known as Citta’ Invicta, due to the fact that it had remained unconquered in the resistance of the invasion from the Ottoman Empire. However, its other name “Senglea” is derived from the Grand Master who was in charge of its reconstruction; Claude de la Sengle. St. Julian’s Church was the first founding building constructed in the area, more precisely in 1311, when it was known as Isola di San Giuliano or Isola di San Michele and not Senglea. It was heavily affected by the plague in the late 1600s, and narrowly evaded another outbreak in 1813. The villagers erected the statue of Our Lady in the city centre, as a sign of gratitude for the protection of the villagers.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3217 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/malta-96971_960_720.jpg" alt="malta-96971_960_720.jpg" width="480" height="720" />

It was also heavily bombed during the second World War, by a blitz by the Luftwaffe on HMS Illustrious; many villagers were killed and the city lost its Basilica. The devastated site was later visited by King George VI, the father of Queen Elisabeth II, and almost fifty years later, by Pope John Paul II. On the 50th anniversary of the blitz, a monument which honours the local victims of both World Wars was unveiled besides the Basilica on the 5th September 1991. In 2001, Senglea won a European Destinations of Excellence Award for aquatic tourism.

Lastly, Cospicua, or “Bormla” also has a third title- Civitas Cospicua. The name “Bormla” comes from Bir Mula, which translates into “well of the Lord”. This double-fortified city is the most densely populated city out of the three, boasting almost 6,000 inhabitants. Bormla has been inhabited since Neolithic times, and its maritime use dates back to 600BC. The Order of St John took roughly 70 years to complete the fortifications of the city, and it was only declared a city by Grand Master Marc’Antonio Zondadari, in 1722. The dockyard constructed by the Order was consequently used by the British Royal Navy during their rule, and was proven to be particularly useful during the Crimean war and the First World War.

Cospicua celebrates its well known feast on the 8th of December, in honour of the Immaculate Conception, and it’s also known for its Good Friday procession, a popular tourist attraction.

These cities remain largely unvisited by locals and tourists alike. However, take a chance and book the “Two Harbours Cruise”  tour with Fun Malta (follow this link: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise">https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise</a>). You will be truly amazed by the wonders these cities have to offer.

            [content] => As the 21st of September is rolling by, we want to celebrate the anniversary of our independence from the British rule, and more particularly, our uniqueness- there’s no other nation like us.

Face it, you love us. From the way we wake you up at 6am with our church bells, to the random “IL-LAMPUKI!” or “TAL-BIGILLA” screams in the middle of the road. We’re adorable.The Maltese people are the embodiment of Mediterranean temperament; everything we say, everything we do, is done with passion and joie de vivre. We understand why you’d want to be more like us, so here are seven tips and tricks to help you integrate with our nation.
<h3>1. Waking up with a “te’ fit-tazza” and a “pastizz”;</h3>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jKaFXbKyZFja0/giphy.gif" alt=" gif food excited hungry sushi GIF" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">We don’t all drink tea in a glass and eat “pastizzi” everyday, but this is truly the breakfast that makes us feel patriotic from the get go. Super indulgent, comfortingly soft and easy on the wallet. You’re so welcome. And yes, okay, it is very high in calories, but that only means that there will be more of us (and you) to love.</span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BY_AUuChw9n/?tagged=pastizzi
<h3>2. Learning these phrases;</h3>
We’ve all been through it; that random lady starting a conversation on the bus, most of the time, in Maltese. What do you do?
<ol>
	<li>a) Panic,</li>
	<li>b) Get off the bus, or</li>
	<li>c) Fake it till you make it?</li>
</ol>
We’ve taken the liberty of choosing option c) for you, and with these phrases, you’re bound to ace any conversation in Maltese

“Mela”- meaning “of course” “granted” “you are absolutely right”

“Istra”- meaning “wow I’m impressed by what you are saying”

“Jaħasra/ Miskina”- meaning “I empathise with you, storyteller”

“Ċaw!”- meaning “bye!”, for when the storyteller departs.

<h3>3. Going to Gozo for a holiday;</h3>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/i1hiQy3uVZ0KQ/giphy.gif" alt=" parks and recreation parks and rec retta donna meagle self care GIF" />

Also known as the ideal staycation, or the holiday (a few kilometers) away from home. Our foreign counterparts laugh at us, however there’s nothing more relaxing that visiting Malta 2.0; the natural, quiet, hustle and bustle free Malta, predominantly known as Gozo. You see, we love our country so much, we ask ourselves, “What’s better that going on holiday in our own country?”. And the truth is nothing. Nothing is better. Gozo is clean, fresh, a true weekend break. You know it’s hard to resist.

<h3>4. Complaining about “long” “far away” journeys...in Malta;</h3>
You could possibly come from a country where the nearest Mcdonalds is about an hour’s drive away, so the fifteen minute car ride from St. Julians to Valletta might seem like a dream to you. For us, anything longer than 30 minutes is a total and utter nightmare.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif0C9va5XEfwrL2/giphy.gif" alt="The Hills driving the hills traffic 1x05 GIF" />

And the parking? Let’s not even go there.
<h3>5. Going to the Village Festa;</h3>
Put on your village “colour”, grab a cold six pack of Cisk and head over to the Village square for a night of music, loud singing, junk food and band marches. Every year we become very patriotic, somewhat religious, and proud of our Village festa, then we forget all about it, but the point is that we will welcome you to our festa with open arms, and we’ll even offer you a beer and a sing along!

Of course that only accounts for half the Maltese population. The other half complains about late-night fireworks, loud music, littering and (you’ve guessed it) the lack of parking around the village, on facebook.

<h3>6. Letting the weather predict if you’re going out tonight</h3>
The first rain as summer starts coming to an end always brings about floods, relief (because now you have a good excuse not to wash your car), excitement (no more heatwaves...perhaps?) and...facebook posts, alerting the Maltese nation that yes, it’s raining, just in case you can’t hear the rain beat down on your office windows.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gRnSZSRzOJeG4/giphy.gif" alt=" rain window rainy day GIF" />

However, the real Malteser (not the candy) element here, is the fact that we are somewhat genetically predisposed to being afraid of going out in the rain. Understandably so. Malta’s roads flood ever so easily- it is of no surprise that cars tend to break down easily during the rainy season. And obviously there’s our hair- those weekly hairdresser blowdries don’t come cheap, you know. Stay in, make a tazza te’, and enjoy the weather.

<h3>7. Bringing a three course meal, wherever we go;</h3>
Are we going to the beach? Let’s pack a lunch. Work? Pack a lunch. Picnic? Pack a lunch. Cinema? Pack a lunch (in all fairness, cinema snacks are overpriced, so mum might have a point here).

And when we say lunch, we don’t mean a light sandwich. We mean “just in case you need to feed yourself and 30 of your  friends” lunch. We don’t follow the “eat until you’re not hungry” rule- we follow the “eat until you tear the seams of your jeans” rule. Explains a lot, doesn’t it?

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/7cByCwKMbILLi/giphy.gif" alt=" lunch GIF" />

The “more to love” rule also applies here.

We cannot guarantee a passport, but what we can guarantee is that now you really are one of us.

            [content] => Mosta is a traditional Maltese town, constantly developing and re-inventing itself, keeping up to date with the modern exigencies of its inhabitants. However, Mosta is also considered a highly historical and cultural town, renowned mainly for two things; the Rotunda and its urban legends.

The “Rotunda” of Mosta (formally known as the Parish Church of the Assumption) boasts of its status as the third largest unsupported dome in Europe. Construction on the church started in 1833, its round shape based on the Pantheon in Rome. The church is said to be of miraculous properties; during World War II, a 500kg highly explosive bomb fell into the church during mass, yet it did not explode. Not only did this miracle save hundreds of lives, but it also saved the integrity of the beloved Church. Currently, a similar bomb is now displayed in the sacristy at the back of the church, under the words "The Bomb Miracle, 9 April 1942".

Mosta’s most famous folktale <i>and </i>ballad, known to all of its inhabitants, young and old, must be the “Bride of Mosta”, or more commonly known in Maltese, “l-Għarusa tal-Mosta”. This legend introduces our heroine, Marianna, who was to be wed to her neighbour, Toni. A Turkish servant of Marianna was also enamoured by her, but she thought nothing of him. Defeated, he escaped the island and went back to Turkey, however, on the day when Marianna was to be wed to Toni, a pirate ship with none other that the Turkish servant raided the Maltese Islands, thus the Turkish servant proceeded to vengefully kidnap Marianna and take her to his shores.

Toni was brokenhearted, yet he soon thought of a plan to save his beloved. He disguised himself as a wool merchant, and travelled to Turkey, where he vowed to find Marianna and save her. One day, after months of searching with no success, he heard a traditional Maltese song being sung sweetly by a female voice. Toni followed the voice to the Sultan’s quarters, and realised that his bride was being held there. Luckily for the couple, the Sultan’s daughter befriended Marianna, and vowed to save her and return her to her beloved. Their plan was a success, and upon their return to Malta, they wed, with their families present, and presumably lived happily ever after.

While this legend of love and abduction has no actual historical basis, it is documented that during the middle of the 16th century, around 400 prisoners were abducted from Mosta and taken by Turkish corsairs. It is however documented that a woman dressed as a bride, was one of the taken. A garden, known as the “Bride of Mosta” garden, was duly named after this folktale.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZEyr1rh4aL/?taken-at=64619

Another attraction in Mosta, which is also entangled with an urban legend, is the Speranza Chapel, found in the Speranza valley. This chapel was built in the 1700s, and the urban legend concerning this building is also tied to a Turkish invasion, as abductions within the village of Mosta were a common occurrence at the time. Legend has it that during one of such invasions, a young girl and her sisters, whilst tending to their family’s sheep, were persecuted by a group of Turkish pirates. Her sisters managed to escape, yet the young girl could not run fast enough. She hid in a cave, situated underneath the Chapel, and prayed to Our Mary for salvation, and promising that if she saved her, she would build a chapel dedicated to Our Lady. When the Turkish invaders arrived at the mouth of the cave, there was no sign of the young girl. In fact, it is said that there was a spider web covering the mouth of the cave- they reasoned that if someone did enter the cave, the web would not be intact. They therefore fled the scene, and the young girl was saved.

            [content] => Malta and the arts- they go hand in hand. This tiny island is packed with local talent, and attracts musical acts from around the world. The following are a few well known acts to follow this year- trust me, they will knock your socks off.
<h3>1. Rotting Christ- 23rd September, 2017</h3>
This gig will be held at the new and highly raved about “The Garage”, Zebbug. Rotting Christ is a Greek extreme death metal/grind band,  formed in 1987. The current band members are the original; Jim (bass) and the brothers Sakis (vocals, guitar) and Themis on drums. They are predominantly known for their ground-breaking album <i>Passage to Arcturo, </i>and have toured and performed in festivals all over the world, including Waken Open Air in Germany, 2003. They are currently working on another album, set to release in 2018.

<h3>2. Black Sabbath; The End of the End, 28th September 2017</h3>
If you haven’t had the privilege of watching Black Sabbath live (born in the wrong decade?), don’t miss out on the chance of watching their performance at the Eden Cinemas. It won’t be live, but it will sure feel like it. Black Sabbath were an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968- the golden age of rock- by guitarist/ songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler, drummer Bill Ward and the notorious Ozzy Osbourne. They are famous for ultra-catchy, expertly crafted hits like “Crazy Train”, “Iron Man”, and of course “Paranoid”. Rock fan or not, this will be an experience to remember, all in the comfort of a cinema.

<h3>3. The Hives, 29th September 2017</h3>
This Swedish rock band made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, through the release of their album <i>Veni Vidi Vicious, </i>home to their number 1 hit “Hate to Say I Told You So”. This was followed by albums such as <i>Tyrannosaurus Hives, The Black and White Album </i>and <i>Lex Hives. </i>They have also collaborated with music legends such as music producer Timbaland, in his hit song “Throw It on Me”. An act not to be missed!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZESSBDjAan/?taken-by=thehives
<h3>4. Rockestra, 30th September 2017</h3>
A true slice of local talent- Rockestra covers rock ballads and hits immaculately, making it a spectacular show for both adults and children. Directed and performed by the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra at the MFCC Ta’ Qali, organised by the Malta Community Chest Fund to raise money for those in need, there is absolutely no reason why you should not attend.  Expect glitter, confetti, lights, and of course, real Maltese talent.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZUFSZbn3X8/?tagged=rockestra
<h3>5. Lacuna Coil, 10th November, 2017</h3>
Lacuna Coil is a gothic metal/alternative metal band from Milan, Italy- one of Italy’s most successful rock and roll exports to date. Formed in 1994, the band was formerly known as Sleep of Right and Ethereal. Its main focus is on the contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies that help create a melodic, detached sound. The band's 2012 release, <i>Dark Adrenaline</i>, peaked at number 15 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. They have toured internationally and were nominated for a MTV Music Award. This show will definitely be a nostalgic trip to the past!

<h3>6. Boyce Avenue, 11th November 2017</h3>
Held in the Mediterranean Conference Centre in Valletta, this is the one show you don’t want to miss. Boyce Avenue was formed in Florida, by brothers Alejandro Luis Manzano, Daniel Enrique Manzano, and Fabian Rafael Manzano. The band is named after a combination of two streets the brothers lived on as children. They rose to fame through videos of acoustic covers of original songs displayed on  youtube, solo or even in collaboration with other popular artists such as Megan Nicole and Hannah Trigwell. Even though they are best known for their covers, their debut album entitled <i>All We Have Left </i>contained original music, including lead singles such are “Every Breath”, “On my Way” and “Broken Angels”. Boyce Avenue has since racked up over 3.3 billion views on Youtube, and garnered over 9.8 million fans and subscribers. Ideal for hardcore fans or for those who want to try something new.

            [content] => Maltese people; we like to try everything once. We’re not afraid of taking up a foodie challenge, and let’s face it, sushi is very much out of our Mediterranean comfort zone. However, once we experience something, and we truly love it, we’ll do our best to integrate it into our everyday life, and make it our own. Therefore it is of no surprise that Malta boasts of excellent sushi joints around the island, ranging between cheap eats and fine dining. This is the ultimate blogger’s list, a blogger who loves sushi very, very much.

<h3>1. Club Sushi, Paceville</h3>
This place specializes in both Japanese style and Korean style cuisine, which is amazing because they are both equally delicious and appetizing. However, their sushi is definitely a highlight. The sushi bar is placed right behind clear glass, for anyone to watch the sushi chef roll out his magnificent creations, and boy are they magnificent. These pieces of sushi are works of art, the kind that you don’t really want to eat, because they are that perfect, but it is sushi so you’re obviously going to eat it.

<h3>2. Gochi, Paceville</h3>
To go or to stay? That is the question. This tiny restaurant caters for sushi take-out or dine-in, but whichever you choose, the experience is going to be the same. The sushi is fresh, bountiful and very good value for money. The atmosphere is zen, and the people making your sushi are the nicest. The perfect “let’s pick up some sushi and stay in bed watching Rick and Morty” venue for your sushi take-out.

<h3>3. Okurama, Paceville</h3>
If you are ready to eat, and I mean really EAT, choose the buffet option at Okurama. You’re allowed two rounds of sushi, and one round of everything else...and this applies to each person choosing the buffet option. So imagine what going to Okurama with a bunch of friends would do to your waistline (so worth it though). This way, you can eat your weight in sushi, try out their other delicacies and have space in your supplementary stomach for dessert!

<h3>4. Zen Sushi, Mosta, Qormi and Luqa</h3>
Another take-out or dine in option, yet this place exceeds all expectations. It is not your typical sushi place. The quality is sublime, and you can feel it with every bite you take. It is slightly on the pricey side, but for good reason. It’s fresh, tasty and made the moment you order it. Highly recommended!

<h3>5. Zest, St. Julian's</h3>
This is the ultimate fine dining experience. The staff will treat you like royalty, their menu will astound you with all its imaginative creations, and the food...get ready for brilliant fusion cuisine. Combined with a lovely view overlooking spinola bay, this restaurant is the ultimate treat.

<h3>6. Sako Sushi, St. Julian's</h3>
Sako sushi, in combination with Wagamama, delivers the fastest and tastiest sushi that Malta has to offer. It uses a conveyor belt system, hence the “fastest” part, you can simply sit down and start picking out your plates. Perfect for the hungry sushi lover on the go! The plates are all colour-coordinated, granting the ultimate satisfaction of knowing exactly how much you are going to pay for each plate. Don’t be surprised if you go over your budget though, this sushi is truly addictive! The sushi chefs can also create sushi rolls for you on demand, don’t be shy to ask them!

<span style="font-weight:400;">Notte Bianca, or “White Night” in English and “Lejl Imdawwal” in Maltese, is one of Malta’s most prestigious outdoor events, attracting over 60,000 people per year.This is the culture festival’s 12th year in Valletta; rumour has it that this year’s festival, directed by Sean Buhagiar, is ready to exceed all expectations. A large variety of specialist art exhibitions, musical performances, and dance shows will be taking place in the streets and piazzas of Valletta throughout the night, and locals exhibiting traditional crafts and selling local produce will bring forth that touch of traditional Maltese culture to the night. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">When we say that all of Valletta comes to life, we really mean ALL of Valletta- from the city gate, to Fort St Elmo, the streets and roads will be filled with music and entertainment. Even venturing to the Upper Barrakka gardens will be a treat- the view of the Three Cities at night will be nothing short of wonderful. Merchant Street, Strait Street and all the old Valletta side roads will be filled with stalls as well as open shops, for that bit of late night shopping. If you’re feeling cultural or artsy, all museums around the city will be open, including the Archaeology Museum and St. John’s Cathedral. This is a great opportunity for those who would like to get lost in, explore, or learn about Valletta in the most creative </span><span style="font-weight:400;">way possible.</span>

As any proud Maltese person will tell you, there’s nothing quite like digging in to a hot plate of grandma’s </span><span lang="en-US"><i>bragioli</i></span><span lang="en-US"> after a long day, or if it’s raining and cold outside.</span>

<h3><strong>1. Go on the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valletta Ghost Tour</a></strong></h3>
As you may or may not know, Valletta has a LOT of history. From The Great Siege of 1565, to both World Wars, it is safe to say that if ghosts were in fact real, they’d all be hanging out at Cafe’ Cordina, waiting to “BOO” you during the Valletta Ghost Tour. Apart from visiting Valletta in all its nightly glory, you’ll be able to learn all about the ghosts which inhabit the area- almost transported in time! Book through Fun Malta- follow this link right here for more information: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour</a>

<h3><strong>2. Dress up as Fundamentally Maltese Characters</strong></h3>
What’s stopping you from dressing up as your favourite Maltese personalities? From La Vallette to your mother-in-law, the choices are truly endless. Some good couple costume ideas are the Maltese Flag, the Azure Window (R.I.P), and possibly twistees and kinnie. Extra points for dressing up as pastizzi.

<h3><strong>3. Go Trick or Treating</strong></h3>
So once you’ve decided on your costume, it’s time to show everyone what a truly Malta-loving trick or treater you are. Major areas to hit may be Sliema, St. Julians and Swieqi area, where lots of children and teens alike attempt trick or treating. Whether you trick or receive a treat, it’s great fun!

<h3><strong>4. Watch a scary movie</strong></h3>
What’s better than movie theatre popcorn, candy, and a screamer? Go to the Eden Cinemas on halloween night- there are many horror movies out right now, as tis’ the season to be absolutely terrified! From Stephen King’s  “IT” to the notoriously creepy “Mother” (not even Jennifer Lawrence can make this film less horrifying), the seat jumping in guaranteed.

<h3><strong>5. Make these cute Rice Krispy Treat Brains to gross out your friends and family</strong></h3>
[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="650"]<img src="https://leftbraincraftbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Rice-Krispy-Treat-Brains-Square-Left-Brain-Craft-Brain.png" alt="Image result for rice krispy treats brains" width="650" height="650" /> <i><span style="font-weight:400;">Via Left Brain Craft Brain</span></i>[/caption]

These are a no-brainer (get it?); they are so simple to make! All you will need is 6 cups of Rice Krispies Cereal, red food colouring, red gel icing some cooking spray, 3 tablespoons of butter and a bag of mini marshmallows. Melt the butter, add marshmallows and heat until melted, adding the red food colouring as you stir. Add the cereal and stir into the gooey mush, and once all cereals are evenly coated, spray hands with cooking spray and shape the cereal mush into tiny little brains. Add icing gel for decoration!

Happy halloween!

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">A fortified city known by many names; Mdina, Citta’ Notabile or even Citta’ Vecchia, yet the most striking of names given is <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2016/09/13/the-silent-city-from-above-an-aerial-view-of-mdina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The Silent City”</a>, due to its quiet, respectable and almost eerie disposition. You’ll find it beckoning from almost every region in Malta, due to its position on the highest hill in the centre of Malta- the main reason why our forefathers thought it wise to fortify and declare it our capital city until the 1530s. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3465" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/malta-2744589_960_720.jpg" alt="malta-2744589_960_720.jpg" width="540" height="720" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Full of history, culture and tradition, Mdina’s history dates back 4000 years, as it was occupied by the Phoenicians, the Romans and soon after, the Arabs, who gave it the arabic name of “Medina”. According to the Holy Bible, within the Acts of the Apostles, it was St. Paul’s shipwreck which introduced the people of Melite (a name adopted during Roman rule) to Catholicism. St. Paul’s Cathedral is dedicated to this momentous event, yet it was severely damaged in the 1693 Sicily earthquake. It was restructured and rebuilt in Baroque style by Lorenzo Gafa’, and is in fact regarded as Gafa’s masterpiece.  The Domvs Romana, a </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Roman-era house</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">containing several well preserved mosaics, the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">c</span><span style="font-weight:400;">atacombs, St. Paul's Grotto; these are all</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a testament to the Roman rule in Mdina. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Throughout modern history, Mdina gained its status as Citta’ Notabile (the Noble City) due to the fact that it was (and is) home to the most respectable noble and religious figures in the country, descending from Norman, Sicilian and Spanish rulers, which gave Mdina its beautifully majestic palaces and artistic monasteries and churches. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3479" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/church-1961450_1920.jpg" alt="church-1961450_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1280" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Mdina will greet you with its city gate, the main gate to the fortified city, built in Baroque style back in 1724. Beyond the gate, you will find cobbled streets leading to museums, churches, fine restaurants and cafe’s. If you’re a history aficionado, visit Palazzo Falson, a historic house museum built for Maltese nobility and the second oldest building in Mdina, containing antique domestic belongings and collections. If you have a flair horror and gore, visit the Mdina Dungeon Museum, a recollection of terrible Medieval tales of torture located in the dark secret passageways underneath Palazzo Vilhena. If you are more likely to enjoy the city when relaxed, visit Fontanella Cafe’ for some good food, exquisite cake and a marvellous view of the Maltese countryside. There are so many ways to appreciate this beautiful city.</span>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3476 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/malta-2668329_960_720.jpg" alt="malta-2668329_960_720.jpg" width="540" height="720" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Mdina is enjoyed at anytime of the day, but it is particularly enjoyed by night, when the streets are empty and quiet, the city is dimly lit, and exploring is encouraged. Currently, around 300 people inhabit the city, with a strict “no cars allowed” policy for pedestrians to roam around freely, conserving its royal and antique atmosphere. It is of no wonder that it is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">You might think that this blogpost is detailed enough, yet it doesn’t even begin to describe the wonders of Mdina. If you’d rather enjoy visiting the city in a guided tour, visit <a href="http://www.funmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fun Malta’s website</a> and book the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/rabat-mdina-san-anton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Rabat, Mdina and San Anton Gardens” tour</a> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">or the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Night Tour”</a></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> for a thorough yet enjoyable visit to Mdina. </span>

            [content] => <span lang="en-US">The humble Gin and Tonic is quite possibly one of the most refreshing alcoholic drinks you could ask for. This simple drink is generally made using one to three parts of gin (that depends on your tastes, or how hard a day of work you’ve had…) to three parts of tonic water, some ice, and a slice of lime, lemon, or cucumber to top it all off. Whether you’re a die-hard fan of the traditional recipe or are up for something a little fancier, we’ve got you covered darling.</span>

But sometimes, travelling isn’t all sunshine and mojitos - sometimes, you’ll have to deal with the odd…hiccup or two. Let’s take a look at some tried-and-tested tips to help you have the most laid-back flight possible, no matter where you’re flying to!</span>
<h3><strong>1. </strong><b>Make a list</b></h3>
<span lang="en-US">Your list is your friend. Making a list of all the things you’ll need for you holiday will help you dial down the packing panic, save time, and keep things strictly to the essentials. No, you don’t need 9 pairs of shoes. Put them down. Good job.</span>

<h3 align="LEFT"><strong>2. </strong><b>Wear something comfy</b></h3>
<span lang="en-US">Whether it’s a 3-or-12 hour flight you’ve got ahead of you, comfort is the key when you’re travelling. The last thing you need when you’re dealing with those all-important security checks and questionable leg-room is an uncomfortable outfit.</span>

<h3 align="LEFT"><strong>3. </strong><span lang="en-US"><b>Stay organised</b></span></h3>
<span lang="en-US">Save yourself the hassle of rummaging through your bags and keep any important documents you’ll need in one, easy-to-find place. A plastic envelope folder works perfectly, but you can also find some pretty travel wallets, made specifically for the job, online.</span>

<h3 align="LEFT"><strong>4. </strong><b>Know your transport links</b></h3>
<span lang="en-US">Do a little research before you fly to find out the best and most efficient ways to get from A to B once you’ve landed in your dream destination. You’ll save time, and there’s nothing better than knowing you’ve got your routes and transport options sorted out ahead of time.</span>

            [content] => Are your inner carnivore senses tingling? Do you need to get your fix? Look no further- this list provides you with an indefinite ranking of the best steakhouses in Malta- the “steaks” have never been higher (get it? Steaks, stakes? Okay, let’s move on)!

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/c11ISnPiRdis8/giphy.gif" alt="NETFLIX meat grill steak grilling GIF" />
<h3><strong>1. <b>Brass amp; Knuckle, Naxxar</b></strong></h3>
This restaurant offers the best quality cuts money can buy, to be enjoyed as a dine-in experience, or to be taken home and cooked to your personal liking. However, the dine-in option is highly recommended (who wants to be washing dishes after a delicious steak, anyway?). You get to choose your meat, your cut, and have it cooked to your liking. Brass amp; Knuckle is also home to the best Wagyu beef in Malta- pricey, yet an otherworldly experience!

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BZqWRWTl2H7/?taken-by=brasssandknuckle/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>2. <b>Chukkas, Marsa</b></strong></h3>
Set in the Malta Polo Club, right opposite the track, this Argentinian steakhouse offers a relaxed, friendly environment in order to enjoy the juiciest of meats. Their Argentinian steaks are cooked on a log grill, which is found on the ground floor of the establishment, and boy is the pay-off astounding. The prices are more than reasonable, and the staff is super friendly. Bring all of your friends, as large groups are catered for exquisitely, and enjoy the most succulent steak on the island!

<h3><strong>3. <b>Dayfresh, Birkirkara</b></strong></h3>
This is no ordinary restaurant- this is a 2-for-1: a butcher’s and a restaurant. This restaurant also offers the commodity of dining in or taking your cut home. Once you order your drinks, the chefs will greet you and explain the variety of fresh cuts in store that day- from grassfed New Zealand to bistecca alla Fiorentina, and they will also recommend the best way to eat the cut chosen (some are best enjoyed rare!).  A casual, warm setting to enjoy your custom made steak.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/37du51LqeN1ni/giphy.gif" alt=" parks and recreation thank you leslie knope ron swanson steak GIF" />
<h3><strong>4. <b>BosSteaks, Marsascala</b></strong></h3>
Situated right across Marsascala bay, this one of a kind restaurant and grill has a name that explains it all- the steaks here are boss. They offer the best Scottona steaks and the most authentic Italian meat dishes, such as the 'Scaloppina di Vitello' and 'Carne alla Pizzaiola’. They also offer the meatiest, most luscious rack or ribs on the island. Let’s do the math- perfect setting+ steaks+ ribs= let’s go!

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/7v91uwGpfcun6/giphy.gif" alt=" steak GIF" />
<h3><strong>5. <b>Meet Argentinian Steakhouse, St. Julians</b></strong></h3>
This restaurant can be found on top of Ryan’s bar, overlooking Spinola Bay and all of the hustle and bustle of St. Julians. It combines the best of Argentinian cuisine, the most flavourful and deepest wines, with a South American atmosphere. The meat is cooked on a parrilla, a style of grill used for cooking “asado”, or barbecue, commonly used in Latin America. The menu offered is extensive, yet the rib-eyes steal the show every time. Missing out on this would be a missed steak.

<strong>Għadam tal-mejtin</strong>
<div>

<em>Ingredients yield around 18-20 almond bones</em>

For the pastry:
800g plain flour, sifted
300g sugar
125g shortening
125g margarine
3 eggs
Juice of half a lemon
Vanilla essence
Dash of milk

For the filling paste:
400 grams sugar
400 grams pure ground almond
80ml water

You will also need some icing sugar and optional crushed almonds for decoration.

</div>
<div></div>
<div>Method:</div>
<div></div>
<div>

1. Make the pastry by rubbing in the shortening, butter and flour until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Mix the sugar with the eggs and add the mixture above.

2. Add the lemon and the vanilla essence and knead it. Add the milk and knead it to an elastic dough.

3. For the filling put the sugar and the water on a low flame and when sugar melts add the almonds. Blend the mixture very well, and let it cool.

4. Roll out the pastry and cut out your shapes. Make two of each figure as they will be sandwiched with almond paste.

5. Lay the first shape on a greased and floured baking tray, spread with almond paste, leaving a small margin. Lay the second shape over the top and press the edges together. Wet the edges with a brush dipped in milk to ensure adhesion.

6. Bake at 180'C/350'F/gas 4, for about 20 minutes, until pale golden. Cool on the tray before decorating.

7. When the bones are cold, coat with light royal icing. You can sprinkle the top with crushed almonds if you wish. Let it dry for few minutes and they are ready to enjoy!

For families who love a getaway or two, a travel destination to consider is the island of Malta.

<strong>Magnificent Malta</strong>

As a “sun and sea" destination, Malta is home to many majestic beaches, each with crystal-clear turquoise-blue waters that seemingly stretch on forever. Some of the island's best are listed in <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/05/08/6-beaches-in-malta-youll-fall-in-love-with/">our post the ‘6 Beaches in Malta You’ll Fall in Love With’</a>. Malta is also home to an array of stunning views, picturesque sceneries, and culturally significant heritage sites.

<strong>When Travelling to Malta</strong>

For families planning a getaway to Malta, it is best to plan ahead. The following tips will be useful:

1. <em>Pack for the Climate</em> – The climate in Malta, <a href="http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/malta">according to The Commonwealth</a>, is typically Mediterranean—lots of sun during the summers, mostly cool during autumn and spring, and mildly cold during winters. So, consider when the trip will be and pack accordingly.

2. <em>Plan an Itinerary</em> – Planning gives a family the opportunity to choose the best destinations, chow down the finest delicacies, and try out all the must-do activities that a place has to offer. Best of all, the family can stay within a set budget and avoid overspending.

3. <em>Try the Local Cuisine</em> – Malta offers diverse dishes, and the food that is available on this beautiful island, is a definite must-try. The cuisine is diverse and delectable, with treats available for every type of palate. Qaqocc mimli, or stuffed artichokes, is a traditional Maltese dish that is prepared in a variety of ways from household to household. Helwa tat-Tork is a sweet delight made of tahini, almonds, and vanilla, and an absolute gastronomic delight.

4. <em>Immerse Yourself in History</em> – Malta is steeped in culture and rich in tradition, and what better way to enjoy this destination than to experience first-hand its culture and traditions. One way to do this is to take part in village festas, which are long on merrymaking and steeped in tradition. Here is <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/08/18/the-maltese-village-festas-where-to-go-this-summer/">Shortletmalta's list of the best festas</a> and their dates so tourists can plan accordingly.

5. <em>Get Some Sleep</em> – Adequate sleep should always be part of any getaway because it gives the body and mind enough time to recover and recharge. Unfortunately, falling asleep in a different bed in a different room and in a different time zone can be quite difficult for some people. However, that doesn’t mean you cannot enjoy your holiday; it just means you should avoid certain things to ensure you get enough rest. <a href="http://blog.leesa.com/how-to-fall-asleep-fast-our-25-best-tips/">Leesa lists 25 tips that can help people sleep</a>, which are ideal for people on vacation. Some of the tips include cutting down on caffeine, increasing the amount of fruit and vegetables in your diet, and avoiding electronic gadgets while in bed.

<strong>Why Traveling is Important</strong>

<a href="https://stuffedsuitcase.com/5-reasons-why-travel-is-good-for-your-family/">Stuffed Suitcase encourages people to enjoy a getaway</a> once in a while because travelling is a proven stress-buster. It is also a wonderful way to create memories that last a lifetime.

Travelling can also be an eye-opener and an opportunity to learn not only about the places being visited, but also about each family member.

Equally important, travel is good for children. Travelling activates triggers that release neurochemicals—opioids, oxytocin, and dopamine, most notably—that enhance brain development.

<strong>Making Memories in Malta</strong>

A family that travels together creates memories that can last forever, and there are very few places on Earth where families can make more beautiful memories than on the island of Malta.

<h3>First things first- why recycle?</h3>
<ol>
	<li><b>Recycling conserves our natural resources</b>, meaning that products are recycled in order to make new products, without having to resort to nature, i.e extracting fresh, raw material from the Earth, saving natural habitats.</li>
	<li><b>Recycling saves energy</b>, as using recycled materials, instead of using new raw materials and starting from scratch, means using less energy (especially when considering the extracting, refining, transportation and processing of raw materials costs).</li>
	<li><b>Recycling helps protect the environment- </b>recycling means reducing the need to extract raw materials from  Earth, removing the need for mining, quarrying and logging, all of which are processes which contribute immensely to water and air pollution. This means that greenhouse gases are reduced, therefore reducing the impact on climate change, therefore saving the penguins and the polar bears. Here’s a cute polar bear GIF to encourage you to recycle-<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/aK4wh0UE3oddS/giphy.gif" alt="Polar Bear Time GIF" /></li>
	<li><b>Recycling reduces landfill, </b>as the total amount of waste sent to the landfill reduces, reducing greenhouse gases.</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight:400;">As a global community, we all need to do our bit. Whether we are at home, in our own country, or on vacation, the rules of recycling should always be followed.  Recycling in Malta will soon be made compulsory in our effort to reduce our impact on the environment, and new laws implemented at the end of the year will require people to separate recyclable, organic and waste streams. A new Littering Act is also in the process of being drafted. I could mention thousands of reasons why these are all brilliant ideas, but instead I’ll direct you to the link below, to see for yourself-</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight:400;">So let’s get right to it- these are the Dos and Don’ts of recycling in Malta:</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DO- Get some grey or green bags for home collection arranged by your local council (you can click on this link here-</span><a href="http://www.wasteservmalta.com/homecollection-"> <span style="font-weight:400;">http://www.wasteservmalta.com/homecollection-</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> to check collection times in your area).</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DO- Deposit recyclable waste in one of the Bring In sites if you are on the move (four coloured bins adjacent to each other, one for paper, one for plastic, one for glass and another for metals)- these are available across Malta and Gozo. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DO- Include paper, cardboard, plastic, metals and juice or milk cartons in your grey recycling bag after they’ve been cleaned with some water and soap. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DON’T- Include the following items in your grey bag; glass, broken mirrors or porcelain, tissues, wet wipes, nappies, cling film, unclean foil, stickers, bottles still containing any cleaning agents or cosmetic product, non-empty spray cans, lighters, batteries and bulky metal or plastic objects. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DON’T- Throw away old clothes that you’d like to leave behind, in order to obtain more luggage space. Clothing materials do not eventually disintegrate like cotton and cause environmental damages. Look for big, blue, box-like bins around the Maltese Islands, supplied by Refab Malta, and deposit the clothes there, for them to be reused or recycled. Unless, of course, you’d like to donate them to an animal shelter, to keep their dogs warm at night. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DON’T- Ignore these rules, or else Al Gore will be disappointed, and nobody wants a disappointed Al Gore. </span></li>
</ul>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26gsl1MREibHbIxs4/giphy.gif" alt="Leonardo Dicaprio Applause GIF by The Academy Awards" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Even better than recycling, you can follow the other two simple ‘R’ules- reduce and reuse. Reducing the amount of waste recycled can greatly impact the amount of waste to be sent to landfills or recycling centres. Reducing waste goes hand-in-hand with reusing items that you have in the house, giving them a new purpose other than the original, thus keeping them around and not throwing them away. For some inspiration, watch the youtube clip below: </span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDQcBQUDpw

<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta is all about relaxing and enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and nobody can deny the benefits of a vacation. However, you too can return the favour and do your bit when it comes to keeping our Island clean and environment friendly. Happy holidays! </span>

            [content] => Soppa tal-armla is a winter staple in many a Maltese home. It is a hearty and filling dish which is also healthy, making it a perfect dinner option on cold Winter nights. 'Soppa tal-Armla' means Widow's Soup in Maltese, and it refers to the humble ingredients it is made up of; ingredients which even Maltese widows of the past could afford. Yet although the ingredients are modest, the taste is not! Here's how you can make this flavorful soup yourself:

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">As I was driving home last night, I noticed that the streets were decorated brightly, some houses already had little Santa Claus robbers climbing up their balcony, and Pama Supermarket readied their Christmas tree outside their shopping mall. Lovely. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Then, in a panic, it hit me. It’s Christmas in a month’s time. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Sure, Christmas is said to be a time for family, for festivities, for togetherness. All positive things. For others, like myself, it means one thing, and one thing only- a surplus of food, which my body can barely handle. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Okay that was a lie, my body can handle the food surplus. It can handle it so well, that last year, my love handles became just a little bit more prominent. I’m pretty sure that this year my body is more than ready to make more room for all that lovely festive food. No doubt actually. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Yet this is a healthy eating post. My mission this month is to go on a healthy detox, anticipating the stuffing-my-face-with-all-that-is-good mission, and I’m positive that there are others, like me, who will be following suit (post-Christmas love handles is an epidemic and this is the cure). </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SasDDqOSRclNu/giphy.gif" alt="Mr Bean Eating GIF" />
<span style="font-weight:400;">The only problem is that I’m a die-hard, self-professed foodie. This island has so much to offer; culture, history, tradition, long walks along it’s many beaches. However, being Self Professed Foodie, I choose to regard the abundance of tender, heart-warming, comforting food Malta has to offer as both its best attribute, and its curse.  Therefore, it’s hard to convince oneself to eat super healthy food, be more active and follow all the fitness instagram accounts for that touch of inspiration, in a country rich with super good, mostly carb-y, majorly fatty, food. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">This is therefore my gift to you, fellow foodie, panicking Shortlets Malta readers. Here is a personal list of the top 7 Healthy Eats in Malta.</span>
<h3><b>1.  Eeetwell, St. Julians</b></h3>

There’s something for everyone- having eaten there a few times myself, there’s no way one can leave the premises disappointed with their order. Healthy, convenient, and delicious!</span>

<h3><b>2. Bongo Nyah</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Perfect healthy date night option, or a great consideration for when you want to go out with your fellow foodie friends, who don’t dare to sway from their foodie ideals. They have meals, platters, cocktails, different kinds of cuisines from all around the world- most importantly, it’s the place to be for a chilled night out with friends.

<h3><b>3. Yue Bistro by Munchies, Naxxar</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This place is located within the limits of Naxxar, making it extremely central and easy to reach. Their menu boasts a healthy etiquette when preparing food, and they even have healthy burgers (salvation!). Their range of vegan desserts are to die for (don’t knock them till you try them), and what’s more, they are located right next to the YUE gym. What’s stopping you from a gym session and a healthy bite right after? Nothing, absolutely nothing.</span>

<h3><b>4. The Grassy Hopper, Valletta and Gzira</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Found in the capital city of Malta and the locality of Gzira, this restaurant specialises in vegan and vegetarian cuisine. This place started off as a kiosk, moving on to open two localities of the same name. They are experts in carefully choosing the best quality foods, to give you high quality carbs and low GMI foods, without refined sugars and starches. The same take out or dine in option also applies, making it the perfect location for a healthy snack on the way to one of Valletta’s many sites (visit <a href="http://www.funmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Fun Malta website</a> for more encouragement, or<a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/10/20/6-things-you-didnt-know-about-valletta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> follow this link</a>!</span>

<h3><b>5. Pash- The Healthy Option, St. Paul’s Bay</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This healthy eats option stems from the most humble background- the owner of Pash was a farmer, who steadily became a large importer of fruit and vegetables in Malta. His healthy lifestyle ethic transferred onto his business venture- that of establishing a vegan and vegetarian restaurant/cafe’ in a country where vegetarian options were, and still are, scarce. Pash serves serve healthy food, be it vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, organic but most importantly, they serve healthy food at its finest quality and state.</span>

            [content] => Imqaret are Maltese traditional, diamond shaped sweet pastries, filled with dates and sprinkled with icing sugar.

These sweets can be enjoyed in any season, but they sure do go down well during the cold winter months! Read on to find out how to prepare these yummy pastries.

            [content] => Christmas is just one week away, and so this week we present to you the epitome of Christmas sweets: the Christmas Cake. Malta's Christmas Cake is pretty much the same as the English Christmas Cake, having been introduced to the island during the 200 years of British Rule. Yet this dessert has formed a special place in the Maltese repertoire, and can still be found almost everywhere during these festive times.

	<li>1 tbsp Armagnac or brandy</li>
	<li>250g marzipan</li>
	<li>500g ready to roll icing</li>
	<li>A little icing sugar</li>
	<li>Silver balls to decorate</li>
	<li>A cake board</li>
	<li>A set of 3 star cookie cutters</li>
	<li>Red ribbon</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Method:</b></h3>
<ol>
	<li>You will need a 20 cm round cake tin, greased and lined with a double thickness of baking parchment, or bake o glide and a spot of oil. Tie a band of brown paper or (a double thickness of news paper will do) round the outside of the tin with string for extra protection. Preheat oven to 140*C/Gas Mark 1</li>
	<li>Now all you do is sift the flour, salt and spices into a very large mixing bowl, then add the sugar and butter and either whisk or beat with a wooden spoon until everything is light, pale and fluffy.</li>
	<li>Now gradually fold in the pre-soaked fruit mixture, chopped nuts and treacle and finally the grated lemon and orange zest.</li>
	<li>Next using a large kitchen spoon, transfer the cake mixture into prepared tin, spread it out evenly with the back of the spoon and, if you don't intend to decorate the cake with marzipan and icing, lightly drop the blanched almonds in circles over the surface.</li>
	<li>Finally cover the top of the cake with double layer of baking parchment with a 50c - size hole in the centre (this gives extra protection during the ling slow cooking).</li>
	<li>Bake the cake on the lowest shelf of the oven for 4 hours until it feels springy in the centre when lightly touched.</li>
	<li>Sometimes it can take 30 to 40 mins longer than this, but in any case don't check for 4 hours.</li>
	<li>Cool the cake for 30 mins in the tin, then remove it to the wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
	<li>When it's cold, feed it by making small holes in the top and bottom with a cocktail stick and spooning in a couple of tablespoons of armagnac or brandy then wrap it in double baking parchment secured with an elastic band and either wrap again in foil or store in an airtight tin.</li>
	<li>You can now feed it at odd intervals until you need to eat it.</li>
	<li>Place the cake on the cake board, then melt the jam with the armagnac or brandy in a small saucepan, stirring until all the lumps have dissolved.</li>
	<li>Now using a brush, coat the surface of the cake quiet generously with the melted mixture.</li>
	<li>Take the marzipan and roll it out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar and cut it to 20cm round and place this over the top of the cake.</li>
	<li>Repeat this step with the icing, and place it over the marzipan.</li>
	<li>Using the cutters, cut out one star of each size from the remaining rolled put icing, dampen one side of the largest star with cold water and then place this side in the centre of the cake. Then repeat with the medium and small stars.</li>
	<li>Decorate the edges of the cake and the stars with silver balls using a little water mixed with a little icing sugar as a glue to keep the silver balls in place.</li>
	<li>Keep the cake in a tin and tie a ribbon around it on Christmas day.</li>

Today it can be served as a delicious hot beverage on the night of Christmas Day, as a relaxing remedy to a truly bustling day!

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">No matter what time of year you choose to visit Malta, any trip to this Mediterranean hotspot is incomplete without spending at least one day exploring our sister island. Gozo (Maltese: </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Għawdex) </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">is just a 30-minute ferry ride away from the northernmost part of the island, with return tickets costing €4.65 for adults, €1.15 for children (kids under 3 travel for free) and €15.70 for a car plus its driver (for more information, check out the Gozo Channel website). Now that we’ve got the basics covered, let’s take a look at some things you absolutely must see and do if you’re spending one day in Gozo!</span>
<h3><b>1. Take in the scenery at Dwejra</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">We may have lost the legendary Azure Window, but Dwejra offers some truly breath-taking views nonetheless. This one’s located at the other end of the island, roughly an hour away by bus and 30 minutes away if you’re driving - but trust us when we say that it’s worth it. Besides, every stop on this little one-day tour will take you closer back to the harbour for your return to Malta!</span>

<h3><b>2. See the shrine at Ta’ Pinu</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This minor Basilica is located Għarb, around 23 minutes away from Mgarr by car and approximately 45 minutes by bus. Ta’ Pinu is arguably the most famous church in Gozo, and was built in the neo-Romanesque style between 1920 and 1931 on the site of what used to be a 16th century chapel. The structure itself is stunning both inside and out, but the shrine is something else entirely. Every year, thousands of people visit the shrine to offer thanks, pray for good health or a speedy recovery, or simply to stand in awe at the collection of curious artefacts people have left there in thanks following their own miracles - no matter how big or small.</span>

<h3><b>3. Have a bite to eat in Xlendi</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Xlendi is one of our favourite places to hit when we want to feast on some fresh fish or simply have a drink while enjoying the gorgeous sea views this place has to offer. After seeing the sights at Dwejra and Ta’ Pinu, it’s time for a well-deserved pit stop so that you can rest and refuel for the next part of your day! If you’re here during the warmer months, we recommend treating yourself to some ice cream and taking a relaxing walk along the little promenade before heading to your next spot.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbM04oXhLdJ/?taken-at=223865984/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><b>4. Step back in time at Ggantija Temples</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Located in Xagħra, these megalithic temples are some of the most significant archeological sites on the Maltese Islands, and have even obtained UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Dating back to around 3600 - 3200 BC, these temples get their name from the Maltese word ‘ġgant’, meaning ‘giant’ - when you see the size of each individual stone slab, you’ll see why it’s been given that name!</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbFWmxxlQz8/?taken-at=263309935/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><b>5. See the Cittadella and round off the day with dinner </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">After you’ve seen the temples, you might just have a bit of time to do some shopping in Victoria, but we recommend spending some time seeing the majestic Cittadella! You can’t miss it - this walled city is located on a hill overlooking the city, and looks glorious when it’s all lit up at night.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba4Yr4wD4ea/?tagged=cittadellagozo/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<span style="font-weight:400;">You’ll soon start to feel peckish, though! If you’re in the mood for some cheap, authentic Gozitan-style pizza, then grab a take-away box of deliciousness from Maxokk Bakery in Nadur - it’s a local favourite! If, however, you’re looking to have a sit-down meal, then here are just a few of our favourite eateries in the Mgarr area: </span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Xerri Il-Bukkett</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Country Terrace</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">It-Tmun</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Ta’ Tona</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><b>6. Get the ferry back to Malta!</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">You’ve done a </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">lot </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">today - we know you’ll probably walk through the door and keep walking until you hit the bed. Sweet dreams!</span>

            [content] => Maltese is a pretty tough language to learn, we’ll grant you that. There are tons of grammar rules to remember, the pronunciation can be somewhat hard to muster, and don’t get us started about the silent letters! Last year, we had already shown you <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2016/11/18/seven-essential-maltese-phrases-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seven Essential Maltese Phrases</a> which could help you find your way around Malta, and we felt it was time for a little refresh.  So here are six Maltese phrases which will help you communicate with the locals, whether you’re buying bread from the nearby bakery, or out partying in Paceville!
<h3><img style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlyypRzngfgVJqE/giphy.gifOne of the phrases you will be using the most – whether out buying coffee or drinks, or souveniers for that matter. When something is priceless, you can now ask for how much it costs, in Maltese! Tista tghini? (tiss-ta tainy?) Can you help me?https://media.giphy.com/media/Fex8y28xO00Fi/giphy.gifThe cry of lost travellers around the globe – asking for help, and knowing how to ask for help, can be a lifesaver. From figuring out bus times, to asking directions to that great restaurant you heard about, you’ll surely be needing some help at some point. Mhux nifhem. (moosh nif-emm) I don’t understand.https://media.giphy.com/media/oiJ0Yf3sLucp2/giphy.gifWhen friendly Maltese people randomly come up to you and start blabbering in Maltese, this is the phrase to use. It is much more productive to show that you are not in fact, conversant in Maltese; maybe the conversation will resume in a language you both can speak. Minn fejn int? (minn feign int?) Where are you from?https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMU17eDlWSrUXVm/giphy.gifYou will probably hear this phrase constantly, especially if you’ve got an accent. This phrase will also come in handy when making new friends, especially if you’re in a multi-cultural environment. Your new friends will love learning this small slice of Maltese! Kif tghidha bil-Malti? (keef tay-dah bill ma-lty?) How do you say that in Maltese?https://media.giphy.com/media/9YhtGOcJcwq64/giphy.gifYour Maltese mates will love this! Most Maltese love teaching their foreign friends new words and phrases in Maltese, and saying this is basically a free pass for learning ALL the Maltese words! You can think of random phrases and back those up with ‘Kif tghidha bil-Malti?’ and you’ll get yourself a Maltese lesson in no time. You’re welcome. Il-Milied it-Tajjeb!

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If you’re visiting Malta for the first time, you’ll probably already know about our stunning capital, Valletta, and the ever-enchanting ‘Silent City’ Mdina; but don’t forget about Vittoriosa, Senglea, and Cospicua - also known as The Three Cities! If you look out over the Grand Harbour from Valletta’s Upper Barrakka Gardens, you’ll see the imposing bastions that have protected these historic cities for centuries. You can easily get to any one of the three by bus, and it’s well worth spending a full day taking in all the authentic Maltese sights that each city has to offer. Before you plan your trip to the Three Cities, let’s take a look at a few things you might not know about them! </span>
<h3><strong>1. <b>They’ve got two names</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">That’s right! Vittoriosa is also known as Birgu, while Senglea and Cospicua also go by the names of Isla and Bormla respectively. Confused? Don’t worry. You’ll get it in time. </span>

<h3><strong>2. <b>You can get there by boat</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you don’t feel like taking the bus or driving to the Three Cities, then why not take the ferry from Valletta, right across the harbour? You’ll get to see some unbeatable views of the bastions and you’ll save time to boot!</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbg26qXgY6P/?tagged=thethreecities/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>3. <b>Vittoriosa was our first capital city</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">And Mdina was our second! The Knights of St. John made Birgu their seat of power, later renaming the city ‘Cittá Vittoriosa’ (roughly translated to ‘the victorious city’) in celebration of the Maltese triumph over the Turkish armada in the Great Siege of 1565. </span>

<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<h3 id=":13r" class="ajR" role="button"><img class="ajT" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" /><strong>4. <b>The Inquisition dropped by for a bit…</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">When the Inquisition blazed through Europe and South America in the 16th and 17th centuries, they didn’t miss this little island in the middle of the Mediterranean. While very few structures from that period remain, Birgu is home to the Inquisitor’s Palace, which was built in the 1530s to serve as law courts (and a prison) for anyone accused of committed acts of heresy in Malta. Today, visitors can learn more about our island’s religious traditions, with historic reconstructions and exhibitions on display all over the beautiful palace. </span>

<h3><strong>5. </strong><b>Birgufest is totally a thing</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">And you should attend if you have the chance! Birgufest is an annual event that celebrates the city’s rich, proud history. Streets are lit up by soft candlelight, looking almost other-worldly, and there are loads of activities, re-enactments, and museums (with discounted entry) to enjoy with friends and family. It’s a magical night out and definitely one you’ll remember!</span>

<h3><strong>6. <b>The cities were hit hard during WWII</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">During what later became known as ‘the Siege of Malta’, the strategically well-positioned Three Cities were very heavily bombed, with almost every building either sustaining damage or being razed to the ground. Never to be defeated, the Three Cities rose again after being rebuilt in the 1950s and 60s.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbaHtFeFssT/?taken-at=259596426/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>7. <b>Senglea keeps an eye on the harbour</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">We mean that quite literally! Head to Gardjola Gardens in Senglea and you’ll be treated to sweeping views of the Grand Harbour, best enjoyed from a beautiful watchtower perched on the side of the bastions. The watchtower has eyes carved into it, in a typically-Maltese style, which are said to keep misfortune or evil spirits at bay. </span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BS61zE5ABGC/?tagged=gardjola/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>8. </strong><b>They’re home to some of the friendliest locals you’ll ever meet</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">A visit to any one of the Three Cities will have you meeting some of the nicest, most welcoming people on the island. You’ll get a real taste of Maltese hospitality here - ask for directions, and the chances are your ‘guide’ will walk you there themselves and give you a quick tour of the place while they’re at it! (We’re only half joking about that one)</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQHwqDwgDaw/?tagged=thethreecities/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>9. You can book a night tour of Vittoriosa…with dinner</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you want to explore Birgu at night, then our <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vittoriosa night tours</a> are the answer! Join us for a one-and-a-half hour trip through the city’s enchanting history, with an optional dinner waiting for you at the end.

            [content] => One of the best things about Christmas (after being able to stuff yourself silly with festive food and naughty holiday treats) has to be seeing the look on a loved one’s face when you <em>know </em>you just nailed the perfect Christmas gift. It’s not how much you spend on a present, of course. It’s all about the thought you put into coming up with something you know they’ll love, and taking the time to wrap it up nicely until Christmas day rolls around. It’s not always as easy as we’d like things to be when you’re trying to think about what to get your nearest and dearest, but have no fear: we’re here to help. Let’s take a look at a few Christmas gift ideas for you to consider this festive season!
<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong>Present-Filled <em>Papoċċ </em>(Present-filled slippers)</strong></h3>
Think of this as a cute Christmas stocking with a bit of a twist. With the cold winter weather tapping at our doors, it’s safe to assume that everyone appreciates a little something snuggly to keep their toes warm. For this quirky gift idea, you’ll need to buy a (preferrably fluffy) pair of slippers and fill them with thoughtful bits and pieces that you know they’ll love. Not sure where to start?

<h3><strong>2. An Adult-Life Survival Kit</strong></h3>
Perfect as a Secret Santa fit, or when your bestie just need a pick-me-up after a tough time, the Adult-Life Survival Kit adds a hint of humour into the mix. For this thoughtful gift, you’ll need to choose a few different items that (in your opinion) will help the recipient through the trials and tribulations of what many call ‘adulting’. Now the contents of your survival kit should vary from person to person - the only things that remain constant are the nice-looking box you’ll package them all up in. Here are a few quick suggestions to get the ideas going:
<ul>
	<li>Mini-prosecco/wine</li>
	<li>Luxury hot chocolate (i.e. the kind you melt into hot milk)</li>
	<li>Painkillers (for hangovers)</li>
	<li>2018 diary or planner</li>
	<li>Scented candle/incense</li>
	<li>Delicious chocolates</li>
	<li>Tea/Herbal tea</li>
	<li>Fluffy socks</li>
	<li>Inexpensive wristwatch</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>3. Pottery Classes</strong></h3>
<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/pottery-classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pottery classes</a> in Malta  have become pretty popular in recent years! A fun, hands-on activity for children and adults alike, pottery classes are a great way to introduce that creative person in your life to what could be a brand-new hobby. Making a piece of pottery is satisfying, and even if it doesn’t turn out 100% perfect the first time around, they’ll still go home with a unique memento!

            [content] => Unless you’re one of those people who totally relate to the Grinch, at least a teeny, tiny part of you will always look forward to Christmas time. From decorating the tree, to trying to convince your partner that you really don’t need so many lights hanging across the façade of the house, and let’s not forget Costa Coffee’s highly decadent, albeit expensive, seasonal hot chocolates- it’s a time for cheer, memories and a sense of nostalgia.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5KuPVqoVRvQcg/giphy.gif" alt="Santa Claus Christmas GIF" />

For some Maltese people, our twelve days of Christmas consist in reminiscing Christmas days passed, with “Nanna” and “Nannu” (Maltese grandparents- an entirely unique breed of grandparents) and all the fun activities we used to engage in. Fond are the memories of waiting for the “ġulbiena” (vetch) to grow, making a “presepju” (nativity crib) with Nannu, and falling asleep during the midnight mass service (to be fair, it was a rather long service). The memories are endless. This year, instead of fondly sharing the memories over a glass of wine too many, why not relive them with your friends and family?

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MrxXXBriEIKBO/giphy.gif" alt="Will Ferrell Christmas GIF" />

Here are some of the old Maltese Christmas Traditions to share with your loved ones this year:

<strong>1. Build a Crib: </strong>this is a fun activity for both children and adults. Whether you are a perfectionist or you just like to improvise and see where you eventually get to, this craft will engage you and bring out your inner artiste. Recycle materials found in your home- from packing materials like jablo or bubble wrap, to newspapers or tiny stones and twigs from your garden, there’s nothing that can’t find a home in your nativity crib. All you need is some imagination and lots and lots of glue. Do yourself a favour though- buy the “pasturi” (nativity scene figures) from a local stationary or specialised shops. You don’t want to attempt shaping a donkey out of paper mache- the results may be horrendous.

<strong>2. Grow your own “Ġulbiena”: </strong>It is traditional, and highly fascinating and educational for the kids, to sow vetch (known to the Maltese as “ġulbiena”) on cotton around five weeks before Christmas day. It is important that the ġulbiena is left in dark areas of the house, until the seeds sprout into long, white, grass-like shoots. The ġulbiena is then used to decorate the nativity crib, so consider this a part two to the previous activity.

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/_e_I34qpUS/?tagged=gulbiena/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<strong>3. </strong><strong>Take your family to the Priedka tat-Tifel, or the Priedka Tal-Milied: </strong>This roughly translates to the preaching, or the sermon, of the child. Within the village, a boy or girl, roughly between the ages of seven and ten, is chosen to deliver a sermon during the midnight mass instead of the priest himself, giving a real sense of what Christmas is all about- the kids, of course. The child is to learn the sermon by heart, and has around four to five weeks to practice it (poor kid- these are not short sermons!). The sermon is usually a touching narration of the nativity story- about Jesus, Mary and Joseph and their many trials in Bethlehem. An endearing and utterly adorable activity.

<strong>4. The village Pageant: </strong>My nanna still owns VHS tapes of my father and aunts taking part in the so-called pageant <em>all </em>those years ago (he denies their existence). All the youths of the village deliver an Oscar worthy re-enactment of the nativity story, complete with baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the donkey (played by an unfortunate human being). This performance is given right before the village midnight mass.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/AbDCwAI2xTwTm/giphy.gif" alt="Leonardo Dicaprio Oscar GIF" />

<strong>5.  </strong><strong>Christmas lunch with the family:</strong> A tradition which is surely kept alive by many other nations. However, the difference is that other nations are not home to the Maltese Nanna, who over-cooks, over-stuffs, and if you didn’t have three helpings of food, you’re obviously sick and she’ll be worrying about you and praying for you for the rest of the year. Take on the role of Nanna this year; serve your “dundjan” (turkey), potatoes and veggies, but only <em>after </em>a helping of lasagne or soup. Finish off with three courses of dessert- Christmas pudding, followed by pastries, and obviously don’t forget the tea o’clock mince pies!

If this blog didn’t make you nostalgic and long for the upcoming month, the Grinch would be totally proud of you. Happy holidays!

            [content] => Malta is a slice of Mediterranean paradise known the world over for its sun-soaked beaches and crystal-blue seas. When it comes to summertime fun, finding something to do is as easy as throwing your sunglasses on. Since our little rock is synonymous with sun, sea, and hot days spent tanning by the pool with a cocktail in hand, it can feel like a bit of a struggle to find things to do in winter if you’re not used to the colder months in Malta. Don’t you worry - winter in Malta is just as awesome as our summers, you just need to know where to go! Here are a few ideas to get you started:
<h3><strong>1. Escape Rooms</strong></h3>
Nothing tests the bonds of friendship, love, and family quite like an <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escape Room  challenge</a>. Put your powers of logic and deduction to the test and Sherlock Holmes your way out of some mind bending puzzles, or just enjoy the inevitable laughs that come with the experience if you and your loved ones fail to get out in time. Either way, it’s a fun, satisfying, and will probably leave you feeling quite pleased with yourself.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYGtCMbPTYWOzaU/giphy.gif" />
<h3><strong>2. Cafes and a Cathedral</strong></h3>
Valletta is stunning at any time of the year, so if it’s rainy just hit the capital! The city is bursting with beautiful historic sites for you to explore - indoors. Visit St. John’s Co-Cathedral and marvel at one of Caravaggio’s iconic paintings, then spend some time discovering more about Malta’s history at the National Museum of Archaeology before taking a well-deserved break at one of the many cafes dotted around the city. Kingsway is a local hotspot, and is located just a few steps away from the National Library, which is always worth a visit.

<h3><strong>3. Wine and Dine in Birgu</strong></h3>
Birgu is the perfect place to spend a rainy day in Malta! Start with a visit to the maritime museum to learn all about our island’s naval history before making your way to a cool eatery like Del Borgo, a wine bar and bistro nestled in one of the city’s narrow streets. Go on - treat yourself to some divine food and drink that’ll warm your soul right up.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdXH5fhjASGgI5W/giphy.gif" />
<h3><strong>4. Have yourself a Happy Hour </strong></h3>
Add some colour (and a few giggles) to even the rainiest of days with a cheeky little happy hour (or three) at any one of Malta’s many bars and lounges. If you’d like to sip cocktails in Sliema, one of Malta’s shopping hotspots, then try Tex Mex, Medasia, or The Black Sheep; Valletta is also home to a few local favourites, including StrEat in the heart of the city and Crave and Hard Rock down by the colourful waterfront!

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2g079qLBiShpu/giphy.gif" />
<h3><strong>5. Visit the Silent City</strong></h3>
When in doubt, spend a few hours in our enchanting ex-capital, Mdina. The Silent City is home to the beautiful St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Norman House if you’re in the mood for a bit of sightseeing and history. However you choose to spend your time in this cultural gem of a walled city, there’s one thing you can’t miss: cake and a hot drink at Fontanella! This quaint cafe is loved by locals and visitors alike, and comes complete with sweeping views of the surrounding towns and greenery.

            [content] => Winter is upon us, ladies and gentlemen! The colder weather may be nipping at your cheeks and rain might be tapping gentle at your windows on some days, but as far as winters go, Malta is blessed with generally warmer weather and more sunny days than most of our European counterparts. While other countries transform swiftly into their own Winter Wonderlands and have everyone snuggled up indoors, here in Malta it’s as good a time as any to put on your walking shoes and explore! Not sure where to start? Don’t worry about that because as usual, we’ve got you covered.
<h3><strong>1. Buskett Gardens</strong></h3>
Perfect for a family day out (and a picnic if the weather permits!), Buskett springs to life after the very first post-Summer shower, with greenery bursting forth and tiny streams babbling along the forest floor after heavier rain. Anyone who’s visited these 16th century gardens will tell you that the old stone structures overgrown with dark, green foliage give Buskett an almost-enchanted feel. Oh, and while you’re there, keep an eye out for the adorable Painted Frogs and other fauna that call this place home!

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BaTYUg6gLg-/?tagged=buskettgardens/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>2. Dingli Cliffs</strong></h3>
You can actually combine this walk with the Buskett option above, because the two places are located very close to each other. If it’s a fiery sunset and a look at real, rugged Maltese countryside you want, then this is the one for you. You can even sit down on some of the perfectly-placed benches to take in some truly stunning panoramic views, and have a little breather before making your way back home.

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcVD8LHlAlo/?tagged=dinglicliffs/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>3. Valletta</strong></h3>
This one’s an say walk, perfect for a lazier day or lunchtime stroll! Our majestic capital city is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and home to a wealth of impressive monuments for you to discover and snap photos of. If it’s not windy, you can even explore the city’s rocky perimeter and see the breakwater up close. Don’t miss the chance to enjoy sweeping views of the Grand Harbour from the Upper or Lower Barrakka Gardens!

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcVRsjelu-0/?taken-at=219990830/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>4. Victoria Lines </strong></h3>
This walk is for anyone up for a bit of a challenge and lasts about 8 hours, with some gorgeous countryside views that are pretty tough to beat. The Victoria Lines are actually a historic landmark - a 12 km long fortification spanning the width of the island. The walk starts from Medliena heights and moved westwards to Kuncizjoni (close to Fomm ir-Rih) or vice versa.

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BSI7zxgh8yI/?tagged=victorialines/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>5. Marsaskala to Marsaxlokk</strong></h3>
This southern walk is a bit of a challenge, but super rewarding, we promise! Starting from Marsaskala, you’ll be able to enjoy breath-taking scenery and unique views of the two harbours located on the eastern side of the island. The fishing village of Marsaxlokk is the ideal place to end a long day’s trek, with typical southern charm and loads of fantastic restaurants to try.

Give your loved one a way to record all the precious moments, memories, and experiences they collect when they’re out on their adventures! You could, of course, go for a simple-yet-pretty version, but you could also opt for a proper Adventure Journal.

<h3><strong>2. A snazzy backpack</strong></h3>
Whether it’s camping or full-on backpacking you friend’s into, they’ll definitely appreciate a good-quality backpack to carry all the bits and pieces they’ll need to make the most of every new experience.

<h3><strong>3. An Action Camera</strong></h3>
If you want to get fancy on the gift-giving front, then why not go for an action camera that’ll allow any intrepid explorer to capture precious moments on video in ways that a normal camera just can’t. The GoPro is a favourite among the travelers and thrill seekers of the world!

<h3><strong>4. A rock climbing session</strong></h3>
<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/rock-climbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rock climbing in Malta</a>  is the perfect way to get up close and personal with our beautiful little island! It’s a balanced blend of fun and physical and mental challenge, and it’s always an incredibly rewarding experience.

<h3><strong>5. Scratch the world map </strong></h3>
For the travelers and wanderers out there, this is a great way to show off and keep track of all the fabulous places they’ve visited when they’re back home. You never know - the map might serve as a challenge, and your friend might end up scratching off every part of it!

<h3><strong>6. An abseiling experience</strong></h3>
Rock climbing not quite right for your thrill-seeking companion? Don’t you worry - <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/abseiling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abseiling</a> certainly sets the pulse racing just as well! There’s nothing quite like the feeling you get when you (safely) lean back and start to rappel down Malta’s rugged-but-beautiful cliff sides.

            [content] => Malta is a cultural and historical haven; it is often said that an entire lifetime is not enough to fully absorb all the history that Malta has to offer its visitors. Every village, every corner, every inch of this island, has historical significance. From the ancient Mdina, to the provincial Bormla, all the way back to the historically glorified Valletta; there’s always something to see, something to know, something to learn from.

Yet, how does one discover all of Malta’s mysteries, how does one learn of all of Malta’s stories, without making the task feel tedious? The answer is rather simple. One must live an experience to truly understand it. Not everyone enjoys excursions, tours, audio guides and pamphlets. Here are the top 5 medieval activities- your indispensable guide to learn what it truly felt to be a knight in Medieval Malta, the fun and interactive way.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Book a session with Malta Archery</strong>: a growing sport, or hobby, in Malta, archery is a truly fantastic way to fully immerse yourself in the Medieval period. The bow and arrow have been used for centuries in hunting and combat- but no worries, this practice is totally safe. Malta Archery caters for both adults and children, providing group or individual sessions, with an instructor who is willing to guide you throughout. So go ahead, bring out the warrior inside of you!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Visit The Trees Medieval and XXL Restaurant: </strong>feast like a King with all your royal subjects at The Trees, found in Gzira. The restaurant has a medieval theme- the staff is decked out in medieval clothes and the atmosphere is dark and dimly lit, just like a tavern. This restaurant is especially famous for its German beer, its humongous steaks and its surf amp; turf options. Go with an empty stomach, their portion sizes are, as stated, XXL- large enough to feed an entire kingdom!</li>
</ul>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/q7kofYLObTVUk/giphy.gif" alt="Lord Of The Rings Hobbit GIF" />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Take the Game of Thrones Tour: </strong>offered by Fun Malta. What’s more Medieval than King’s Landing, Dothraki and a Khaleesi? This tour is not like any other boring tour- the guides are not just any tour guides, but two local actors who have taken part in Game of thrones during its season one filming here in Malta. Although we lost the Azure Window earlier this year, we still have plenty of exclusive locations used for the production, like the Garden of King’s Landing and the Tower of the Hand. A truly enjoyable experience for all the Game of Thrones fans out there. Book your tour today by clicking <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/game-of-thrones-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Go horse riding in Bidnija: </strong>take in the beautiful, unencumbered countryside of Bidnija, limits of Mgarr and Mosta, on the most basic, primitive yet well respected method of transportation known to man: a majestic horse. Bidnija Horse Riding offers rides around the countryside, from village to village. A qualified instructor is assigned, and no experience is truly needed. A perfect occasion to feel at one with nature.</li>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Explore Mdina by night: </strong>join the FunMalta crew once again on an adventure in Mdina, with a dark twist. Mdina is beautiful by day, but spectacularly eerie by night. Stepping through the Mdina gate feels like stepping into a time machine- this Silent City has remained truly medieval. The site of many battles, deaths, and above all Fontanella chocolate cake (hey, medieval knights fancy cake too, y’know)- it is the one medieval experience that you don’t want to miss. Book through <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fun Malta</a>.</li>

<h3><b>1. The Cosmopolitan</b></h3>
 
The drink of choice for the fashion-savvy Carrie Bradshaw (Sex and the City, for the uninitiated), the Cosmo is a delightful mingling of sweet and sour flavours with a lovely, cheerful pink colour. It’s gluten free, and vegetarian and vegan-friendly too. Everybody’s happy, yay!

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/5yEeZA1O8mat2/giphy.webp" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Ingredients (per cocktail)</span>

	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">For the orange zest garnish, hold a piece of orange zest and carefully heat it over a small flame. The ‘outside’ of the zest should be facing the flame so that the flavours and oils are unlocked; drop the zest into the drink or perch it on the rim of the glass. Alternately, place a lime wedge on the rim of the glass.  </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>3. The Wintery Whisky Sour</b></h3>

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If Christmas day is meant for comfy pants and stuffing yourself silly with all the festive deliciousness you can stand, then New Year’s Eve should be synonymous with the clinking of champagne glasses, the people who’ve made your year special, and a sense of excitement at all the promise of a fresh year full of potential. If you’re not settled on your NYE plans yet, here are a few ideas to consider!</span>
<h3><strong>1. <b>Pyjama Party</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Sometimes, the best nights out are the ones spent all cosy at home with onesies, fluffy slippers, and yummy food and drinks to warm the soul. Invite your nearest and dearest, sort out a Spotify playlist, and ring in the New Year in comfort. Can’t host your event at home? Don’t worry - there are loads of <a href="http://www.shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great properties in Malta</a> that you can rent out for the event! </span>

<h3><strong>2. <b>Rock out with Red Electrick</b></strong></h3>
https://www.facebook.com/events/1520902357999172/

<span style="font-weight:400;">Get your tickets sorted and get ready for what promises to be a fabulous night out at Hugo’s Terrace! Home-grown talent, Red Electrick, are set to give you a truly spectacular performance, and you’ll love getting dressed up, snapping loads of photos, and sipping on those sinfully good cocktails. </span>

<h3><strong>3. <b>#Throwback at Tattingers </b></strong></h3>
http://https//www.facebook.com/events/849017055268100/

<span style="font-weight:400;">Party and raise your glasses to the sound of the 80s and 90s, expertly mixed by Djs Clint Bajada, Alfred Zammit, Noel Camilleri, and Chris Funkytown. As you dance your way to midnight and beyond at Tattingers, perched just on the side of the historic Rabat, you’ll be filled with nostalgia for the parties of the past, and buzzing with excitement for the year to come all at once. Cheers!</span>

<h3><strong>6. </strong><b>Winter Wine Night</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you’d rather do something a little more low key with your significant other or maybe just a few loved ones, then book yourself a table at one of the island’s favourite wine bars for a night filled with good conversation, fine wine, and your other great loves: cheeseboards and close friends. If you’re not sure where to go, here are a few of our personal favourites when it comes to wine nights:</span>

            [content] => After all the presents have been unwrapped, chocolates have been eaten, and bottles of wine and champagne have been drained dry, it’s hard to imagine that there could be any more fun to be had over the Christmas season! But let’s not forget about the other days of Christmas break – sure, we don't all get to enjoy an extensive period of festive recess, but for those who do, there’s time to be filled! Not sure what to do other than sit at home and watch festive cartoons? Here are just a few ideas to get you started.
<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong>Have a Movie Marathon</strong></h3>
No matter what your go-to favourite genre may be, a movie marathon at home in your cosiest pyjamas is just heavenly. Use your turkey-and-stuffing leftovers, line up your snack hoard (we recommend popcorn, your favourite crisps, Oreos, some cheeses, <em>galletti </em>and a selection of hams) and treat yourself and your friendly or family members to a day of simple and well-deserved self-indulgence.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/nHLvt59LGHo1W/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>2. Watch The Comedy Knights: Show me the money! at Teatru Salesjan</strong></h3>
There’s nothing like a good laugh to burn those naughty Christmas calories, so get your tickets to what promises to be The Comedy Knights’ best show yet! 2017 was absolutely packed with political intrigue and saucy scandals, so get ready for some seriously good local satire.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/CoDp6NnSmItoY/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Hit the Baystreet Ice Rink</strong></h3>
Perfect if you’re looking for a spot of festive family fun, ice skating is one of the quirkier things to do in Malta given that we enjoy such a relatively warm Mediterranean climate! Don’t worry if you fall flat on your softer parts once or twice - everyone does that, all that matters is that you get up and try again.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o7TKzkhLYrvcUYd1K/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>4. </strong><strong>Spend a day with Sea Creatures and Beautiful Birds</strong></h3>
Treat yourself to the perfect <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/bird-park-aquarium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animal lover’s tour</a>  that’ll take you to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/bird-park-malta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BirdPark Malta</a>  to see some stunning creatures, from elegant pink flamingos to regal swans, wise owls, rainbow-coloured parrots and more! Next, you’ll head to the Malta National Aquarium located along one of our island’s most scenic promenades; with a whopping 26 display tanks and more fish than you could possibly name at one go, you’ll definitely enjoy learning all about marine life, getting to know them up close and personal.

<h3><strong>5. </strong><strong>Explore Buskett Gardens</strong></h3>
A trip to the lush Buskett Gardens is never a bad idea! This 16th century forest is arguably one of the most beautiful places on our little island, and is the perfect place for a long, relaxing walk away from all the technological distractions back home. If the weather is fine, take things to the next level and turn your wintery walk into a cheeky picnic, complete with a big thermos of something hot to drink, snack, and a football to kick about. If the weather is on the wetter side, then head over to Mdina to enjoy some pure Maltese history - and something tasty from Fontanella cafe, a local favourite.

            [content] => This Monday we delve into a Maltese favourite - Imqarrun il-Forn (baked macaroni). This dish is perfect for Winter, but would make a great Summer dish too, especially paired with an ice-cold Cisk! The Maltese way is to cook until crispy, however you can modify this method as you prefer.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3773" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/imqarrun-1.jpg" alt="imqarrun 1.jpg" width="4288" height="2848" />
<h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>
<ul>
	<li>500g macaroni</li>
	<li>2 medium onions</li>
	<li>4 medium carrots</li>
	<li>800 grams minced beef</li>
	<li>curry powder</li>
	<li>nutmeg</li>
	<li>red wine</li>

</ul>
<h3><b>Method:</b></h3>
<ol>

	<li>Simmer, covered for about 30 min, then uncovered for another half an hour.</li>
	<li>Boil the macaroni in plenty of salted water until al dente. Do not over cook it otherwise it will lose shape and texture by the end.</li>
	<li>Pour a cup of cold water into the pan as soon as the pasta is cooked. Drain.</li>
	<li>Mix the meat and the tomato into the macaroni, add the eggs and season.</li>
	<li>Mix well together in a large dish. Sprinkle grated cheese on top.</li>

            [content] => “Brodu” is so much more than a simple chicken stock in Malta.  It’s a hearty meal, with 2 courses,  a delicious broth soup, and then the chicken itself, served with steamed/boiled vegetables, potatoes and crusty bread.
Ingredients:
2 carrots
2 onions
some Celery (leaves and small stalks only if possible,
in Maltese it's "karfus" and you get it for free from all
the veggie men)
Qarabali (Zucchini/courgettes) - 2 small-medium ones.
Mixed herbs (I used Herbes de Provence but you
can use Italian mix, or just thyme if you like)
Salt, pepper, olive oil.
3 or 4 garlic cloves
I whole chicken, with neck/giblets included

Method:
Wash and dry the chicken, trimming off all the visible fat and if you choose, remove the skin.

Prepare a pot big enough to fit the chicken comfortably. Put the heat on low, add olive oil, and chuck in the chopped carrots, onions, celery zucchini and garlic.

Cover and "sweat" for a few minutes until the onions are slightly translucent.

Add the whole chicken, and pour enough water to just cover it. No more! You can always add a bit more later.

Add some herbs, and a generous amount of salt and pepper. A couple of bay-leaves never hurt either! :)

Bring to the boil, then cover and let simmer for at least an hour, until the chicken is very tender and you can pull off a piece easily with a fork.

To serve, remove the chicken carefully and bring the soup back to a rolling boil.

Add a handful of rice as soon as the soup comes to a boil, cook until tender and serve with plenty of lemon juice.

The 2nd course is usually boiled potatoes and spinach/zucchini or other fresh green veggies, all drizzled with lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil.

Some people add potatoes to this soup also, which is fine, but somehow I prefer this one without potato. When it's beef, I like to add potatoes (not when using it as a stock though).

Chicken stock/just the brodu:

To make "just" a stock or to serve just a soup without having to use a whole chicken, use the carcass of a chicken, plus a couple of necks and some giblets. These are available for dirt cheap from your butcher. When I make coq au vin and joint the chicken myself, I keep the carcass, neck and giblets for this very purpose.

Use the same amount of stock vegetables.

To serve as a soup: When the soup is done, remove the carcass, allow to cool slightly and remove any meat and add them back to the pot.

To use as a stock: Remove all the carcass and bones, discard (or use bits of chicken for another dish or sandwiches), strain soup and discard vegetables and bits. The liquid can be frozen and used at a later date. This also works well with roast chicken carcasses/bones with some meat on them.

Happy cooking! :)

            [content] => A quick word of friendly advice in this new year - never underestimate the power of team building activities. When you spend twenty to forty hours a week working alongside the same group of people, it’s super important to spend some time fostering friendships and building stronger bonds with your colleagues - it doesn’t matter if you’re having a cup of tea together in the break room or binge-watching your favourite series together after hours.

It’s no secret that a team that gets on well together socially <strong>works </strong>well! That means a happier office, better company culture, and improved efficiency across the board. In short: there’s no reason <em>not </em>to organise awesome team building days out, and who knows? You might end up finding friends for life right there in your office. Planning your next team building activity? Here are a few ideas that’ll help make it a memorable event.
<h3><strong>1. Segway Tour</strong></h3>
The perfect way to share so many laughs your cheeks will hurt while doing some speedy sightseeing, <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going on a segway tour in Malta</a>  is sure to be a big winner with all your workmates! What’s a segway you ask? Well, it’s a type of two-wheeled scooter that works using your body weight for balance. Simple lean forward to accelerate, and ease up on the foot pedals to slow down or stop. From sweeping views of the Mediterranean sea from Dingli Cliffs, right up to the architectural majesty of our amazing capital, Valletta, you’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to choosing the right route for your team.

<h3><strong>2. Quad Biking</strong></h3>
If segways aren’t <em>quite </em>your cup of tea, then perhaps a bit of <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/quad-bikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quad biking</a>  is what your clan of colleagues needs. A fair bit more intense than segway tours or badger karting, quad bikes are for the more adventurous folks out there! It doesn’t matter if you’re a seasoned rider or are just trying it out for the first time - one thing’s for certain: quad biking will definitely get the adrenaline pumping and smiles spreading across some very happy faces.

<h3><strong>3. Escape Rooms </strong></h3>
A particular favourite of the wannabe-Sherlocks out there, <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escape rooms</a> offer a very different type of challenge - one that needs more brain than brawn. Get your teams together and use your combined wit, brainpower, and deductive skills to make your way to freedom in an Egyptian Adventure, Mozart’s Mystery, or Secret Surgery Room! All you need to bring is your teamwork and your A-game. Warning: may test the bonds of friendship.

<h3><strong>4. Office Trivia/Pub Quiz </strong></h3>
This one’s best mixed in with a good old-fashioned Pub Quiz-style affair, planned as part of day full of team building fun of your choosing. You’ll need to spend some time thinking up some clever questions, and use the internet for any general knowledge questions. You’ll also need a designated quizmaster, some rules, and a small prize for the winning team!

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/8qvSwj9qlinqo/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>5. Karaoke Party </strong></h3>
There’s nothing quite as cheerful, noisy, and guaranteed to make you giggle as a good old-fashioned karaoke night - especially after a fully day out and about with your workmates and with a few well-earned drinks. It doesn’t matter if you can’t hold a note to save your lie - that’s part of the fun! If you’re feeling self-conscious, go for popular classics like the tunes from Grease and Abba. That way, everyone will be up singing with you!

            [content] => <em>Qarabagħli </em>- marrows or courgettes, are a staple in Maltese kitchens, one of those vegetables that are ever present on your <em>Nanna</em>'s countertop. By far the most traditional Maltese way to cook these versatile vegetables is by stuffing them and baking them, resulting in the mouth-wateringly good <em>Qarabagħli Mimli fil-Forn.</em>

            [content] => Ah, the ever-popular <em>Stuffat</em>, the dish that screams at you from every Maltese restaurant's menu - boasting to be Malta's national dish. Well, it practically is our national dish, and most of us do eat it every Sunday, religiously. The <em>Stuffat</em> can be enjoyed during Winter or Summer, as a first course and as a second course. And it tastes unequivocally Maltese. Why not try your hand and making Malta's national dish yourself?

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4016" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/stuffat-tal-fenek-2.jpeg" alt="stuffat tal fenek 2.jpeg" width="640" height="375" />

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

1 rabbit, (approx 1.5kg, cut in small portions)
2 onions, chopped
4 garlic cloves, peeled
5 large tomatoes
2 tsp kunserva (tomato paste)
5 potatoes, peeled and quartered
3 carrots, peeled and chopped
200 g peas (fresh or canned)
6 bay leaves
Pinch mixed herbs
Freshly ground pepper amp; Salt to season
500ml red wine
1 tsp olive oil

<strong>Method</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Marinate the rabbit overnight in the red wine (marinade to include the garlic, garlic, salt amp; pepper</li>
	<li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil, and add the rabbit until slightly brown.</li>
	<li>Add the onions, carrots, potatoes and the tomatoes, and pour half of the marinade on the ingredients.</li>
	<li>Bring to boil on a high flame for about 15 minutes</li>
	<li>Add the remaining wine, peas, bay leaves, kidney and liver and simmer on low heat for about 2 hours, stir occasionally and add some more wine if the sauce begins to dry up.</li>
	<li>Cooking variations - you can choose to make the rabbit stew to look browner by reducing the number of tomatoes and kunserva use, I personally prefer the rabbit stew to have very little tomato past even if it is served with spaghetti.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Spaghetti with rabbit sauce as a starter</strong>

Boil some spaghetti (leave al dente) Cover with some sauce from the rabbit stew, do not add any rabbit pieces if you are serving rabbit stew as a main course, but you can add some of the rabbit liver to the sauce serving Finely grated Parmesan cheese can be added on top.
<em>Happy Cooking!</em>

            [content] => 2017 is over and done with, and people all over the world are looking ahead and making plans that promise to make their 2018 their best year yet. Sound great, right? Well, the thing about those pesky New Year’s Resolutions is that year after year (without fail), we make loads of promises to ourselves with the very best of intentions – but how many of these resolutions do we <strong>actually </strong>keep? The secret to making – and sticking to – your New Year’s Resolutions lies in keeping them simple, and above all being realistic about them. Here are just a few examples that might inspire your plans for 2018!
<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong>Try something new</strong></h3>
This one’s nice and easy, and just perfect if you struggle with keeping your resolutions (to be read: perfect if you’re the kind of person who gives up three days into the New Year). It can be as ‘small’ as trying a type of cuisine that you didn’t think you’d like, learning a new skill or language, or maybe even pushing yourself to try something way outside your comfort zone, like <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scuba diving</a> or<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/rock-climbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> rock climbing </a>in Malta! Who knows – you might end up discovering a new hobby while you’re at it.

<h3><strong>2. </strong><strong>Read more books</strong></h3>
You don’t need to be a full-on literature fanatic to appreciate a good read! Cut down on the time you spend online and create space for yourself to curl up with a good book more often in 2018. It’s an excellent way to unwind after a stressful day at work or school, enrich your vocabulary, and become immersed in another world for a while. If you struggle with longer reads, why not try a collection of short stories or some poetry?

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc-jyQhh7iv/?tagged=bookworm/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Be kinder to yourself</strong></h3>
This one sounds easy at first, but can be quite a challenge. Sometimes, we can be our own worst critics, and we wouldn’t even dream of saying half the things we say to ourselves to the people we care about. So why should you say them to yourself? The answer is: you shouldn’t. Being kind to yourself is about treating yourself with the love and respect your give your nearest and dearest; it’s about claiming the time and space you need for self-care. You’re important! Recharge. Relax. You’ll feel happier and more motivated for it.

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc-kLSqApo_/?tagged=selfcare/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>4. </strong><strong>Forget about your phone</strong></h3>
Attention all smartphone addicts: it’s time to spend less time on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or Tinder and more time being totally present when you’re (meant to be) enjoying someone’s company! If you’ve made plans to hang out with your friends, family, or significant other, then put the phone away. You’re not going to miss anything important on social media, we promise. You could, however, be missing out on precious real-life moments and memories if you don’t!

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o6fJd97kAWWa9Ph28/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>5. </strong><strong>Declutter your life</strong></h3>
The start of a new year is like opening a fresh new copybook at the start of the scholastic year: full of promise and potential – but not if your desk is overflowing with papers, pens, and a Pandora’s Box-worth of chaos. Purge your wardrobe of the clothes you simply don’t wear (why not donate them?), tidy your workspace at home <em>and </em>in the office, and give your life an early spring clean to make sure you start 2018 with less mess and more organisation.

            [content] => Any avid traveller could tell you that there’s no place like Malta. Some may call a trip to Malta a refreshing experience, others… cultural shock. From our loud, passionate natives, to our less than smooth roads (even the Italian actress Monica Bellucci, who came to spend the New Year, commented on how “disastrous” they are), and let us not forget our transport system which leaves much to be desired. We can safely say that our island is quite…different.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l49JQIushQig2JHcQ/giphy.gif" />

Yet for all the negatives, there are definitely positives. Your dear blogger has just come back from a long holiday abroad, and she can safely say that there truly is no place like home. From the sinfully delicious smell of pastizzi wafting down every main street to the friendly, loud “Orrajt, kif ahna?” (translation: how are you?”) booming out of the shop owners’ mouths when visiting any establishment- the Maltese way of life speaks to my soul.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/O6VoexTrRs6eQ/giphy.gif" />

Safe to say, this blog is a celebration of everything which is genuinely, uniquely and endearingly Maltese.

<b>1. Those Sunny Island days</b>

Malta has the famous “Mediterranean Climate”- which can only mean one thing- sun, sun, sun, and more sun! Due to our islands’ high daylight hours, Malta enjoys approximately 3,000 hours of daylight and sunshine each year- an average of 5 hours in December and 12 hours in July. That’s a heck of a lot of tanning time! Consequently, our waters are very warm, boasting of an average of 20◦C- perfect for those who love beach-y holidays. Now you know exactly what to pack for your next trip to Malta.

<b>2. Our love of Fireworks and Festas</b>

Love them or hate them, Maltese Festas are here to stay. Almost every weekend during the summer season, a village in Malta and/or Gozo celebrates a patron saint. This usually means that the village square is full of lights, live bands, bars, food stalls, and…you’ve guessed it, fireworks. The Festa day usually starts as early as 9am with petards, continuing well into the night with a firework show, exhibiting aerial and ground fireworks. If you're visiting Malta within the summer season, expect your nights to be lit by fireworks.

<b>3. Our Language </b>

Fun fact: our language is made up of many variants of languages reflecting our country’s past conquerors; we say that 80% of the language is an old variant of Arabic, and the remaining 20% of it is a mix of Italian, French, Spanish and English. We’re often told that we sound angry when we speak our native Maltese, yet don’t be fooled- we’re probably just discussing what we’re going to eat for dinner. We’re just passionate. If you want to learn the odd yet useful Maltese phrase, check this <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/11/22/6-maltese-phrases-for-your-next-trip-to-malta/">post </a>and <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2016/11/18/seven-essential-maltese-phrases-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>.

<b>4. Our Megalithic Temples</b>

Our prehistoric temples are definitely unique in the world- so unique in fact that some have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites (namely the Ġgantija temples, Hagar Qim, Mnajdra, Ta’ Hagrat temples, Skorba temples and Tarxien temples). They are said to be the oldest free-standing structures on Earth, the oldest being the several temples built during the Ġgantija phase (3600–3000 BC). Definitely, a majestic site that is not to be missed when visiting the island.

<b>5. Our Food</b>

You knew this was coming. Arguably the most important point mentioned in this blog, our food is pretty much what makes us Maltese. From Nanna’s cooking to the yummy oily comforting selection found at the local village pastizzeria, our food is truly unique. We have something for everyone- “gbejna”, the local cheese made out of salted sheep milk (for the cheese fans), and “pastizzi”, our response to America’s fast food- cheap, hot out of the oven, available everywhere and obviously delicious. We also offer our “Twistees”, a crunchy cheesy snack, and “Kinnie”, our herbal soft drink. Finally, we have our Cisk, our home-brewed beer. Make sure to leave room in your luggage to pack some of our delicacies for home!

            [content] => "western">Sliema, the shoppers’ mecca of Malta, the high-rise array rising up from the sea, dwarfing smaller structures with her imperious heights. It is hard to imagine that one can find peaceful spots in this bustling city, with its constant flow of traffic and its myriad of shoppers and businesses. Yet if you look closely enough, and if you know where to look, Sliema might just surprise you with her underlying charm, and provide you with some truly awe-inspiring views and experiences. Ready to deviate from the beaten track and embark on an off-road journey of Sliema?
"western" ><strong>1. Fort Tigne</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb1ivYMHuht/?hl=enamp;taken-by=forttigne/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >No typo there – we are talking about Tigne – yet it is the solitary fort which catches our eye. Engulfed by the gigantic apartment buildings and the shopping centre, Fort Tigne mostly goes unnoticed. Yet this quaint fort has been a stronghold since 1792, when it was built by the Knights of St John. One of its first tasks was defending Malta against Napoleon’s attack in 1798, and it was then put to use by the British, during their 200-year rule of Malta. It is now being restored to its original state, and offers unobstructed views of Valletta’s iconic skyline. It takes a while to find, but it’s SO worth it.
"western" ><strong>2. Take in the Views from the Skyroom Bar at Preluna Hotel</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BDmNWkhKtPx/?hl=enamp;tagged=preluna/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >The Preluna Hotel had in itself been a landmark for a substantial part of Maltese history, being the highest building in the area for many years. It has now been surpassed by many other buildings, yet the view from the Skyroom bar on the 13<sup>th</sup> floor is still jaw-droppingly beautiful. Sip on some cocktails at sunset and snap away to your heart’s content as golden hour veils over the city – be careful not to look down if you’re afraid of heights!
"western" ><strong>3. Escape the crowds at an <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room">Escape Room</a></strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BDNyzf4tkVG/?hl=enamp;taken-by=scavengermalta/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Sliema can feel a little too crowded sometimes, and the best way to beat the crowds is to engage in a fun activity which will also give your brain a workout, all in the company of your friends. While you’ll be trying to escape the room in an hour or less, you will also be escaping the scurrying crowds outside. It is also the perfect solution to a rainy day or even a stifling hot day! There’s nothing an <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room">escape room</a> adventure <!-- https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room -->can’t fix.
"western" ><strong>4. Roam the backstreets of Sliema</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb9qHk9hcu9/?hl=enamp;tagged=preluna/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >While Sliema puts up a modern and futuristic façade, its heart and soul lie in its backstreets – the quiet Sliema of olden days. You can start exploring any backstreet you wish, however, we do recommend finding Freres Street and then getting lost from there. You’ll be surprised at the sheer amount of picturesque Maltese balconies that can be found here, as well as narrow little streets which wind down maze-like. It is actually surprising that a quiet break from Sliema lies just beyond its main streets, yet few people actually bother to look.

"western" ><strong>5. Cuddle with cats at Independence Garden</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BC3maL4SvSv/?taken-by=mymalta.guide/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western"><a name="_GoBack"></a>If you crave some feline attention, head to Independence Garden, where perched on one of the sheltered benches you’ll find a small cat haven. These cats are regularly fed and have cosy blankets and cushions to sleep on, and are blissfully happy with a cuddle or two. When life gets a bit too much, it Is always helpful to cuddle a furry friend; whether you are feeling lonely or sad, or you just want to spend a few playful minutes (or hours, we won’t judge) in the marvellous company of cats. You’ll recognise the garden by the Egyptian-like statue of a colourful cat perched over the garden’s wooden gazebo.

            [content] => "western" >Valletta has become one of Malta’s most hip cities in the past few years. This year it is set out to be more in vogue than ever, while graciously bearing the title of European City of Culture 2018. Cool new shops and restaurants are popping up in Valletta every week, and while they may be fun to discover, they surely do attract some crowds! So what to do if you prefer to visit a quieter side to this city? You get off the beaten track!
"western" >Now Valletta is a diminutive city to say the least, so you will be able to go through the locations on this list in one day – maybe even in one afternoon if you’re determined. Get your cameras (or phones) at the ready, and slide off Republic Street into the beautiful, still relatively unknown, parts of the city.
"western" ><strong>1. Visit the Siege Bell Memorial</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdzKY9jh8wz/?hl=enamp;taken-at=219990830/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >The Siege Bell Memorial lies at the farthermost tip of the Valletta peninsula, perched high on the Castille bastion, greeting and bidding farewell to anyone entering or exiting the Grand Harbour. The Memorial commemorates soldiers buried at sea during the two world wars, and features a solemn bell and a statue of an unknown soldier in eternal rest. The Memorial is directly behind the Lower Barrakka Gardens, and while it does attract some attention, it never amasses the crowds that places like the Upper Barrakka are known for (especially in the summer) – even though the views from here are breathtaking!
"western" ><strong>2. Walk Valletta’s Coast</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BBP4aFdvd2H/?hl=enamp;tagged=vallettabridge/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Moving on from the Memorial, you’ll find a steep flight of steps leading you down to the seashore, just in front of The Mediterranean Conference Centre. Once down by the sea, you can enjoy a rocky walk upon Valletta’s rugged coast, getting up close and personal with the bright red breakwater on a seaside adventure in the city. The St. Elmo breakwater bridge was originally constructed in 1903, yet was given a new lease on life in 2012, making it a striking feature in our natural harbour. The walk takes you around the circumference of the Valletta peninsula, however, be careful - waves may become dangerous, especially during storms. Also, make sure that your shoes are not slippery, or you might end up enjoying an unplanned swim!
"western" ><strong>3. Check out il-Mandragg</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQirtrgljSu/?hl=enamp;tagged=mandragg/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Il-Mandragg is a neighbourhood in Valletta which can be found in the backstreets of the area where the Sliema ferry berths. It was an area known for squalor and poverty during the war, cluttered with diminutive apartments built so high and so close to each other that they blocked the sun’s rays from reaching the streets. The area has now been given new life, thanks to years of regeneration and beautification; however, it still remains hauntingly beautiful in a way that the rest of Valletta isn’t. Il-Mandragg is a part of Valletta which is still quite raw yet bursting with life; it is the area where most Valletta locals live, and it has a totally different feel from the Valletta found on Republic Street.
"western" ><strong>4.Grab a bite at Is-Suq tal-Belt</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdpOt8djJMY/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1034133268/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Finally! Valletta has its own artisan market, housed in an authentic, Victorian-era building which used to be the main food market in Valletta for over a 100 years. Following other cities’ footsteps, Valletta has re-opened its wrought-iron market gates, and transformed a dingy, run-down warehouse into the fantastic example of Victorian architecture it is today. Don’t worry, it won’t just be your Instagram feed thanking you – the food here is truly something else! Your stomach will be eternally grateful when checking out all the different stalls – from humble pastizzi, to elaborate Asian food. Naturally, it tastes that much better when washed down with an ice-cold Cisk while people watching at Strada Merkanti.
"western" ><strong>5. Go underground at Lascaris War Rooms</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BT_O6PCFAA0/?hl=enamp;taken-at=967960174/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Before heading out of Valletta, check out the underground world of Lascaris War Rooms, a series of corridors and chambers which had been used as the headquarters of defence of Malta during the Second World War. Pretty cool huh? It’s even cooler once you see the perfectly preserved rooms, still equipped with humungous maps of Sicily and Malta and with vintage wartime equipment. You’ll be transported back to the 1940s while on this underground adventure beneath the streets of the city, and your Instagram feed will thank you for it, mark our words.

<span lang="en-US"><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horse riding</a> in Malta is super rewarding and a great way to see the islands from a different perspective - all while getting to work with a beautiful animal. It doesn’t matter if you’re a horse riding pro or an absolute beginner - you’ll get all the help you’ll need to get galloping in no time (or at the very least, a nice, safe trot). Not sure where to start? Well, Golden Bay is a local favourite, and comes complete with glorious sunsets and stunning views across the horizon from the comfort of your saddle.</span>

            [content] => The humble orange. As an island located smack dab in the middle of the Mediterranean sea, Malta commands a truly enviable climate for growing citrus fruits! At the right time of the year, you can buy crates of oranges at ridiculously good prices - so sometimes you might find that you’ve got far more fruit than you can actually eat before letting it go bad. Realistically, there’s only so much Vitamin C one person can take in each day! Not sure what to do with all your surplus citrus? We’ve got you covered with a bunch of different ideas.

<strong>1. Brew up some orange and clove tea</strong>

Perfect for the colder months, orange and clove tea will warm your soul and leave you feeling cleansed and quite refreshed. Oh, and this brew is said to help ease stomach cramps!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdcl6bwjJE0/?tagged=orangeherbaltea/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<strong>2. DIY potpourri</strong>

Yep, you read right! You can use dried citrus peel to make your very own potpourri, saving you money and making sure you used every bit of the fruit.

<strong>3. Make some marmalade</strong>

A little more advanced (but a deliciously satisfying challenge!), making your own marmalade is one of the best uses for oranges. Marmalade adds zing to your toast and zest to your crumpets, and you can boast about how you’ve made your own.

<strong>4. Add flavour to your water</strong>

Struggle to drink ‘plain’ water? Granted, it’s not the most exciting drink in the world, but staying hydrated is vital to staying healthy and keeping your skin looking great. Add a couple of slices of orange to your water bottle, give it a shake, and voila - tasty, vitamin-infused water that isn’t a chore to drink.

<strong>5. Make some mouth-watering desserts</strong>

From slices of sinfully-good citrus cake to refreshing home-made granitas, crunchy biscuits, cute cupcakes and beyond, you’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to finding the perfect sweet treat to make with your oranges. Here’s a list of citrusy delights to get you started. Ready? Set. Bake! Don’t forget to send us a piece.

<strong>6. Make a natural orange-scented cleaner</strong>

If you want to cut down on waste and chemicals in your life, then this one’s for you. All you need is a mason jar, orange peels, white vinegar, and some time. Stuff the peels into the jar and cover in vinegar; close the jar (make sure it’s sealed shut) and shake it every couple of days for two weeks. You’re done! Clean away.

<strong><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HIrYP4RI9DpLy/giphy.gif" /></strong>
<strong>7. Treat yourself with an orange peel face mask</strong>

Get your skin looking and feeling refreshed with an orange peel mask! Simply grind the dried peel into a powder (you can use a pestle and mortar for this) and add an equal amount of water or milk until you can mix it into a paste. Voila! Done.
<strong><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IydQxUwzX6ky1q0/giphy.gif" /></strong>
<strong>8. Exfoliate!</strong>

Another mini-spa treatment, use the same dried orange peels (you can dry them in the sun or oven) and grind them up with chickpea flour to make a lovely exfoliator that’ll cleanse your face and/or body. And you’ll smell delicious too.

            [content] => While we may be blessed with more sunny winter days than many of our European friends, we still get the odd cold snap, chilly night, or wet week from time to time. Enter, delicious soul-warming soup that isn’t just comforting, but healthy, delicious, and really quite cheap to make. The ‘soppa ta’ l-armla’ or ‘widow’s soup’ is a traditionally-Maltese, vegetarian dish that gets its name from the fact that the ingredients are cheap (it was actually what you would call a ‘poor man’s dish!). One of the best things about this hearty soup? It’s extremely easy to make. Grab a bowl and spoon because we’re going to get cooking.
Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 onion</li>
	<li>3 or 4 cloves of garlic</li>
	<li>1 onion</li>
	<li>2 potatoes</li>
	<li>2 celery sticks</li>
	<li>2 carrots</li>
	<li>1 kohlrabi</li>
	<li>1 cup podded broad beans</li>
	<li>1 cup peas</li>
	<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
	<li>1 tbsp butter</li>
	<li>1/2 a cauliflower</li>
	<li>1 1/2 tbsp tomato pasta</li>
	<li>Vegetable stock</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
	<li>6 soft gbejniet (Maltese goat’s cheese)</li>
</ul>
Method
1. Wash all the vegetables; peel and chop the potatoes, carrots, and kohlrabi. Slice the celery, crush the garlic cloves, and cut the cauliflower into small, bite-sized pieces. Roughly chop the parsley.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/zsRviQEWP9SHm/giphy.gif" />
2. In a large, deep saucepan, heat the oil and butter together before tipping in the onion, garlic, and majority of the parsley. Sauté, stirring frequently until soft.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/demgpwJ6rs2DS/giphy.gif" />
3. Add the rest of the vegetables, tomato paste, and stock. Stir well before seasoning with salt and pepper.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/73UW5Rfo2osRq/giphy.gif" />
4. Bring soup to the boil and leave it to simmer for around 15 to 20 minutes until the vegetables are cooked through.
5. Add the gbejniet (goat’s cheese) to the soup such that they’re slightly submerged. Cover the saucepan and continue cooking for a couple more minutes so that the cheese has some time to warm up.

6. Throw in the remaining parsley and stir well.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/rkgX9MTBXJa1O/giphy.gif" />
7. Serve in bowls, with one portion of cheese to each one.

            [content] => "western">There are many facets to Maltese culture; one which we are immensely proud of is our colourful and vast music scene. One might think that we limit ourselves to the yearly Eurovision entry, or our traditional “Għana”, but in reality, our national talent stretches far beyond that. Here are some local bands that are making an impact in (and beyond) Malta this year:
"western" ><b>1. Mistura</b>
"western" >Mistura is a Maltese band to be proud of: their lyrics are composed solely in Maltese, and whilst being politically motivated, they set out to make their listeners think and contemplate current affairs, in and beyond the island. Meet the band: Antonio Olivari is behind the thought-provoking lyrics (and some pretty funky guitar riffs), Malcolm Bonnici is the lead singer/ guitarist/ lyricist and official jokester of the group, Matthew Agius is the laid back and groovy bassist, and Mark Andrew Azzopardi is the drummer/ eye-candy of the band. Their musical genre is a nostalgic mix of classic rock with a funky twist, reminiscent of Pink Floyd, Queen, Muse, Radiohead, amongst other influences. You could catch their live performance on the 19th of January in Valletta for Valletta 2018’s Opening Week for Music and Theatre, at Sala San Duminku Community Theatre.

"western" style="text-align:center;" align="CENTER"><i>Courtesy of Mistura’s Facebook Page</i>
"western" ><b>2. Eyes to Argus</b>
"western" >With a new album launched in October 2017, this band is on a steep ascent to fame amongst avid Maltese music connoisseurs, and it is safe to say that they’re well on the way to achieving international popularity. The band was founded in 2013, by Samwel Mallia, Ben Mifsud Joslin and Robert Farrugia. The drummer/ percussionist Kristian Schembri joined the band in 2015. Eyes to Argus offer an experimental and atmospheric sound, with influences ranging from post-rock to jazz, Radiohead to Russian Circles; yet the aim has always been to set a mood for audiences, rather than confining the band to a set genre. Check their new album “VEER”, out on Spotify <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eUiqqAzeTcPsNCC8zoopG">here</a>, or catch them on the 23rd and 24th of February 2018, at the Valletta Campus Theatre, opening for the Italian post-rock outfit Mokadelic.

"western" ><b>3. Fuzzhoneys </b>
"western" >The “Femmetastic” (their appropriately named second EP) girl duo band “Fuzzhoneys” is comprised of Francesca (guitar/vocals) and Caroline (drums/tambourine). It was founded way back in 2012, the typical story of two music fanatics who found that they share a mutual love and understanding of The Doors, The Beatles, Blur, The White Stripes and The Black Keys, amongst others. Their biography immediately sets out a motto for the band, “no rules, but to express”, and their sound has been described as “DIY”- a solely unique. Their debut EP was aptly named “Tal-Genn”, a Maltese phrase meaning “amazing”, and truly it is just that and more. They are currently touring the UK, follow their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fuzzhoneys/">Facebook page</a> for more updates on their adventures!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcdAP9FA-Fa/?taken-by=fuzzhoneys/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><b>4. Plato’s Dream Machine</b>
"western" >This Maltese band has been around since 2009, developing and evolving ever since. Members came and went, yet Robert Farrugia Flores (the band’s lead vocals and lyricist) consistently stuck to the band, and now, together with Mark Abela, Samwel Grima, Francesco Sultana and Daniel Sant, the band is in ship-shape and ready to perform. Their cited influences are Atoms for Peace, Radiohead and Leonard Cohen amongst others, and their main genre is synth-pop. Catch them on the 3rd of March at The Garage, Zebbug, for a live performance, and listen to their highly acclaimed second album entitled “GUF” on spotify!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BXR81t8F2K_/?tagged=platosdreammachine/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><b>5. The Violent Violets</b>
"western" >This three piece band, comprised of André Farrugia on bass, Matthew Shields on guitar and vocals, and Samuel Xiberras on drums, started out in 2009, but the members knew each other way back from when they were students at a secondary school in Malta. They’ve since evolved into a post-punk/alternative band, performing live for the first time in 2011, and had later found themselves performing with local bands and even international artists, such as Joe Gideon amp; The Shark and Tall Ships. Their debut album, entitled “Tame”, came out in 2014, to raving reviews. They’re currently rehearsing and writing new material, so keep an eye out for them this year!

            [content] => "western" >St Julian’s is Malta’s most concentrated touristic and entertainment hub, buzzing with tourists and locals, especially during the summer months. It might seem impossible to picture a quiet spot in this city of the night, however, there are some quaint places which won’t be as crowded as the Paceville steps, or St George’s bay at any hour of a summer day. Need a breather from all the partying? Then check out these 5 calming, and mostly uncrowded spots!
"western"><strong>1. The small beach off of Wilga Street (overlooking Dragonara Casino)</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdnwFNxjIgz/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >You can start your journey in Paceville, the so-named city of peace, which is truly anything but. Stroll down Wilga Street until its very end and you’ll end up in a small but pretty rocky beach, overlooking the flashing ‘Casino’ sign. This beach is a far cry from the stifling, huddled flock that St George’s Bay becomes from the earliest signs of summer (that is, April). Although it does still attract some people, it is a much quieter option. It can also be spectacularly beautiful during the Winter, when crashing waves upon the rocks make beautiful displays.
"western"><strong>2. The Millennium Chapel</strong>
"western">[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BPu90tBBtBr/?hl=enamp;tagged=milleniumchapel/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >I am sure that most of the people visiting St Julian’s and Paceville have no idea that the area is home to an oasis of peace, which in itself is housed in a modern architectural masterpiece by the famed Richard England. Found on the aptly named Triq il-Knisja (Church Street), the Millennium Chapel is open day and night and welcomes anyone needing a moment of quiet in the fast-paced tempo of the town outside its doors. Regardless of religion, this modern marvel is a sight to see, if only for its architectural value.
"western"><strong>3. Hilton Yacht Marina</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdsBkMDhf5o/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >A couple of hundred metres straight on from the Chapel, as you come to the roundabout, you’ll notice a staircase on your left, leading to Portomaso Marina. This delightful area hosts a multitude of restaurants – perfect for a spot of lunch – and offers some serious yacht eye-candy. Grab a bite to eat and stroll around the luxury yachts after lunch, where you can savour the serenity of this little microcosm in the heart of busy St Julian’s.
"western"><strong>4. Walk along Spinola Bay</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdvTp09h0D3/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><a name="_GoBack"></a>As you exit Portomaso Marina, take the first left on the roundabout, leading you down to Triq Spinola. From here you can go further down to the coast, for a picturesque view of Spinola Bay, the more traditional side of St Julian’s. From here you’ll also get a beautiful view of the whole Balluta and Spinola area, perfect for some dazzling photos of the Mediterranean! This area is also known for its cat village, which is exactly what its name implies - a feline-friendly space where you can interact with some gorgeous kitties!
"western"><strong>5. People-watching at Pjazza Balluta</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd0eIETnbmU/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Grab a coffee and find a comfortable bench from where you can admire the diverse architecture at Balluta Bay, as well as the motley crowds of passers-by strolling along the seaside. Balluta Bay is in itself a charming sight to behold, and the wide varieties of people which walk its banks make it an even more interesting location!

            [content] => "western" >With the passing of January, Malta descends into a state of revelry and colourful frenzy, as social norms are bent during the five days of Carnival. The Maltese, as they tend to do about everything else, put their heart and soul into this jovial five day feast; some even start planning for these days a whole year in advance. Let us guide you through the nitty gritty of Carnival in Malta – from where it all started, to what will happen this weekend.


[caption id="attachment_4129" align="alignnone" width="1600"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4129" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/carival-float.jpg" alt="SONY DSC" width="1600" height="1065" /> SONY DSC[/caption]
"western"><b>History</b>
"western" >The word carnival derives from the Italian words ‘carne vale’ which literally means ‘meat is allowed’. During the five days of Carnival meat and lavish food could be enjoyed before the 40 days of abstaining during Lent, where meat was renounced and more humble food was consumed, before the joyous feast of Easter. This fasting period was anticipated by 5 days of gluttony, parades, and general frolic. Carnival in Malta can be traced back to the 1400s, and was boosted further by the Knights of St John. Carnival during the time of the Knights consisted of various tournaments and pageants, during which the Knights themselves competed for rewards. Carnival floats became a tradition during Grandmaster Jean Parisot de la Vallette’s rule – yet it was the Knights’ ships which were decorated and displayed in all their glory, and not the land floats.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4130" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/carnival2018.jpg" alt="Carnival2018" width="1379" height="1035" />
"western" >During the time of the Knights another Maltese Carnival tradition was born – the historic ‘Parata’, which is a re-enactment of the 16<sup>th</sup> Century struggle of the Maltese population and the Knights of St John against the rival forces of the Ottoman Turks, who had besieged Malta during their attack in 1565. The ‘Parata’ was taken quite seriously during the time of the Knights, and the Maltese people eagerly awaited the performance. In modern times the ‘Parata’ became less of a dramatic event and more of a commemorative one, with dance troupes performing the traditional dance/battle between the two opposing forces. Carnival in Malta seemed to wane slightly during the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, but continued steadily even under British rule, making it a tradition that spanned more than six centuries, and which is still going strong today.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4125" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/carnival-st-georges-square.jpg" alt="Carnival St Georges Square" width="2061" height="1378" />


"western"><b>Present Day</b>
"western" >Nowadays Carnival is a period that entices a section of the population to the extent of dedicating a whole year to its preparation – secretly coming up with ideas for colourful floats and accompanying dance routines, ornate foam costumes and witty mottos. The various Carnival troupes around the island enter their floats in the annual competition, determining which float is the best out of all on the very last night of Carnival. These crews are extremely dedicated to their work, spending most evenings and weekends throughout the year working on next year’s Carnival, having only five short days to enjoy their year’s work. The floats are made out of papier-mach<span lang="mt-MT">e and feature bright, garish colours and various decorative lights. Every float has a specific theme and has an accompanying group of costume-clad dancers to match.</span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4126" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/carnival-dancers.jpg" alt="Carnival Dancers" width="2054" height="1373" />
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">The floats are paraded through the streets of Valletta during the 5 days of Carnival, with the last parade taking place on Mardi Gras, or the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent. The final parade takes place in the evening at St Anne Street, in Floriana. After their final performance, the floats meet an unfortunate end – they are destroyed as preparations for the following Carnival commence. Carnival is a time of year associated with Valletta, where most of the spectacles take place – yet these past few years have seen a resurgence in a different type of Carnival in various towns and villages around Malta; a more spontaneous Carnival, which sometimes even borders on the macabre. Yet no town does spontaneity like Nadur...</span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4127" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/nadur-carnival-2.jpg" alt="Nadur Carnival 2" width="960" height="640" />
"western"><span lang="mt-MT"><b>Gozo Carnival</b></span>
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">The Carnival in Gozo is a totally different experience than its Maltese counterpart. Float parades and dance shows are still held in Victoria, albeit varying slightly from the Maltese. Yet it is in Nadur that the Gozitan Carnival reaches its apex. The Carnival in Nadur is spontaneous, meaning that no committee or governing board imposes its rules upon the festivities. This makes this Carnival an unpredictable one, where characters of all shapes and forms roam the streets; most having a satirical or political undertone to their getup. The Nadur Carnival takes place at night, and the place is</span><span lang="mt-MT"><i> extremely </i></span><span lang="mt-MT">popular – so if you’re planning on visiting, make sure to get there early-ish. Costumes are as unpredictable as the Carnival itself – past years have included people dressed up as politicians, nuns, priests and other religious figures, and even as Jesus Christ himself – a costume which did not go down well with authorities. Grotesque masks always abound, making an easy costume for the lazy reveler. The festivities here continue well into the early morning hours and are definitely less PG-rated than the Valletta or Victoria Carnivals. It is worth a visit though, especially if you happen to be visiting Malta’s sister island during this period.</span>
"western"><span lang="mt-MT"><b>Carnival 2018</b></span>
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">This year’s Carnival will take place between the 8th and the 13th February, starting off at St George’s Square in Valletta. Make sure to grab some Prinjolata (the traditional sweet treat associated with Carnival in Malta) and enjoy the show! Coinciding with the year-long spectacle of V18, Valletta’s tenure as the European Capital of Culture, one can expect great things from this year’s Carnival. Whether you celebrate Carnival in Malta or in Gozo, it is certainly a memorable event not to be missed!</span>

Hot beaches, a smouldering sun, cool dips in the ocean, cocktails, a nightlife that allows you to </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>really </i></span><span lang="en-GB">blow some steam off… Sounds a lot like Malta. </span>
"western"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarqlsEW6F7F14Fq/giphy.gif" />
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">So, you scroll over to your browser and start looking for flights. You find what you want- tickets for Malta. Up until this very moment, it was just a little game in your head, a “</span><span lang="en-GB"><i>haha, what if? No harm in checking”</i></span><span lang="en-GB"> scenario, but then, the inevitable happens. You have a strange, all most out-of-body experience: you lose all control, fingers typing away at the keyboard, as if they have a life of their own. You find yourself inputting your credit card details. A few “ok” and “proceed to billing” clicks. It’s done, there’s no going back now. You’re going to Malta! </span>
"western"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MOTkF7sT8u2Z2/giphy.gif" />
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">So tickets are sorted. What’s next? Accommodation!</span>
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">It must be lovely, spacious, with any of the great views that Malta has to offer. There’s only one problem- most hotels that offer just that are fully booked, ridiculously expensive or offer a fantastic view of… a block of concrete.</span>
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">Here at Shortlets Malta, we’d like to persuade you to try out a </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>different </i></span><span lang="en-GB">kind of holiday- why not try renting a holiday apartment? Here are the top four reasons why you should book an apartment with Shortlets today! </span>
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">1. Enjoy the luxuries of building your own timeline for the day: I’ll be the first to admit it- I love buffet breakfasts. Building a scrambled egg mountain, choosing every different type of mini muffin, unlimited cappuccinos... However, something I do dislike (and by dislike I mean </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>loathe with a passion</i></span><span lang="en-GB">) is having to wake up early, or at least, early enough to get to the scrambled eggs and muffins before they run out, or, heaven forbids, turn cold. A self-catering apartment will allow you to wake up as early (or in my case, as late) as you want a build your own scrambled egg mountain, whether it’s at 5 o’clock in the morning (God forbid) or at 1 o’clock in the afternoon. Also, there are no awkward encounters with housekeeping. Independence is a virtue, which you will grow to dearly love!</span>
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/StYTkwUST4HUQ/giphy.gif" />
<span lang="en-GB">2. You get to eat the food </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>you </i></span><span lang="en-GB">want: Are you a Gordon Ramsay, or do you just like getting your hands dirty in the kitchen? Do you have any food intolerances or allergies? If you’ve answered yes to the above questions, then a self-catering apartment is probably the best option for you. In Malta, you can find supermarkets or mini-marts at every corner, stocking brands you’re familiar with, or local brands. You can even get fancy and try some local dishes, take an example from this <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2018/01/29/recipe-monday-qarabaghli-mimli-il-forn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogpost.</a></span>
  <img style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Zt3tXa86LNlYgE0/giphy.gif" />
<span lang="en-GB">You can make it your home away from home: with more facilities than an average hotel room, you and your family are bound to be more comfortable. No banging on walls, no awkward couple raging next door, no toddlers screaming and crying in the hallway. Not to mention, more privacy for those late night wine and karaoke sessions. Holiday homes are typically tastefully and uniquely decorated (a welcome difference from the one room fits all ideology of a hotel), all the home-y extra touches make it feel like come, a welcome idea after a busy day of sightseeing and a hell of a night dancing in a club.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeDD0g5nZYX/?taken-by=shortletsmalta/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<span lang="en-GB">4. One apartment fits all: if you’re a big group of people vacationing together, you won’t have to split up into several rooms by the end of the night. Shortlets Malta will help you find a suitable apartment accommodating your large group so you can share every moment of your holiday together. From dining in  - to watching a movie if the weather is terrible, create new memories and experiences inside and outside the apartment!</span>

            [content] => Kawlata is the kind of soup that originated out of necessity - when people of past times needed to feed as many mouths as possible with as little cost as possible, food had to go a long way. These kinds of soups were invented for this sole purpose, filling empty bellies up with cheap cuts of meat and filling staples so as not to go hungry. Nowadays that food isn't scarce and we have the luxury of choosing what we get to eat every day, we still go for the traditional Kawlata. Why? Because it is a delicious meal, hearty and filling, perfect for warming you up on a bitter cold Winter's day.

<em>Other ingredients</em>
2 tbsp. tomato paste (kunserva)
Rough sea salt and fresh pepper

Usually served with a side of fries, this dish makes for a perfect Sunday lunch!

            [content] => Proudly perched on a natural plateau, the walled city of Mdina is one of the most beautiful historical locations on the Maltese Islands. Known to many as ‘The Silent City’, Mdina also goes by the names Città Notabile (The Noble City) and Città Vecchia (The Old City) and has been around since roughly the eighth century BC when the Phoenicians settled there and called it ‘Maleth’. Later, around 218 BC, the city fell into the hands of the Roman Republic and became known as ‘Melite’ and actually included a big chunk of the neighbouring town known as Rabat today. As you step through the regal city gate, there’s no doubt that you’ll feel like you’ve just gone back in time, and stepped into a picture-perfect piece of history.
<strong>1. It’s just stunning</strong>
It can be incredibly refreshing to spend the day away from the hustle and bustle of urban life, especially when Mdina is your destination of choice. The Silent City may be relatively small in size (a tactical move which made it easier to defend in the event of a siege), but it’s BIG on typical Maltese charm. We particularly love the way the city looks at night!

<strong>2. The view from the Bastions is breath-taking</strong>
Walk through the main gate and straight across to the imposing bastions - in a matter of minutes, you’ll be treated to a sweeping view of the surrounding towns and rolling fields! Seriously - wow.

<strong>3. St Paul’s Cathedral</strong>
Nestled right in the heart of Mdina, this regal cathedral needed some TLC following the damage it sustained when the earthquake hit Sicily in 1693 (oh, and another one hit it in 1856…). The cathedral was rebuilt according to the designs of prominent Maltese architect, Lorenzo Gafà and headed completion in 1705. If you think the outside is beautiful, just wait until you walk through its doors and get a good look at the inside, which follows the classic Latin cross layout and contains fascinating artefacts dating as far back as the fifteenth century (the cathedral is home to an exquisite baptismal front from the early Renaissance period. After you explore everything the cathedral has to offer, don’t forget to swing by the Cathedral Museum to learn a little more about the structure and see some incredible artworks, artefacts, and even some pieces by Albrecht Dürer!

<strong>4. The National Museum of Natural History</strong>
Located just to your right as you enter the city, the museum is housed in a truly impressive eighteenth-century palazzo built by Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena according to plans devised by the French architect, Charles François de Mondion. Take some time out of your day and explore the museum’s extensive collection of fossils, minerals, and loads of other curiosities.

<strong>5. Fontanella</strong>
A trip to Mdina isn’t at all complete without a little pit stop at Fontanella, an adorable cafe loved by locals and visitors alike for its perfect location and delicious chocolate cake. No matter what the weather might be like, settling into a spot at this charming spot with a massive slice of cake and a hot cup of tea is absolute bliss.

            [content] => As home to temples other than the great pyramids of Giza themselves, Malta is an absolute goldmine for the history buffs out there. Maltese summers are made for golden tans and lazy days at the beach, but the rest of the year is perfect for <span lang="en-US"><i>really </i></span>digging into our island’s rich, diverse history. From the awe-inspiring megalithic temples, to the Phoenicians, Romans, Normans, Knights of Malta, two world wars and beyond - we’re about to dip into some of the sights you absolutely have to see if you’re living in or even visiting Malta.
<span lang="en-US"><b>1. </b></span><b>Ħ</b><span lang="en-US"><b>agar Qim and Mnajdra</b></span>
Ħagar Qim commands a sweeping view of the sea, with the islet of Filfla clearly in its sights; Mnajdra is just a few minutes away, and both templates are nestled in rugged, Mediterranean countryside. Hagar Qim (c. 3600-3200 BC) means ‘standing stones’ and was first excavated in 1839; the site is made up of a big central building and two smaller structures, following a layout typical of the prehistoric structures found on the Maltese islands. Loads of amazing artefacts were found at the site, including statuettes of human figures, which can be seen at the National Museum of Archaeology. Mnajdra is made up of three temples, with one of them dating as far back as 3600-3200 BC. The site shows extensive use of the dot-pattern used for decorative purposes at other megalithic temples located on the islands.

<span lang="en-US"><b>2. The Hypogeum </b></span>
The Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum is an incredible underground burial site dating back to the Neolithic period (c. 3300-3000 BC). The site was discovered completely by accident during construction work in 1902, and was excavated for the first time by Father Emmanuel Magri, and continued by Sir Themistocles Zammit. Holding the remains of over 7000 humans, the structure is thought to have been used as a burial ground and stands as one of the best and most well-preserved examples of the prehistoric temple-building that produced Hagar Qim, Mnajdra, and the Xaghra Stone Circle.

<span lang="en-US"><b>3. The Grandmaster’s Palace</b></span>
Located in Palace Square right in the heart of Valletta (the 2018 European Capital of Culture), the palace is home to the Office of the President, the House of Representatives, and a fabulous armoury filled with artefacts from the Order of the Knights of St John’s glorious past.

<span lang="en-US"><b>4. St John’s Co-Cathedral</b></span>
An absolute must-see if you’re exploring our stunning capital city, Valletta, St John’s Co-Cathedral is an exquisite example of baroque architecture built by the Order of the Knights of St John between 1573 and 1578. Everywhere you look in this majestic structure you’ll see breath-taking art and precision, from the marble floor populated with angels and skeletons to beautiful paintings across the ceiling and two Caravaggio masterpieces, you’ll be overwhelmed by the Cathedral’s lavish interior.

<span lang="en-US"><b>5. Lascaris War Rooms</b></span>
Perfect if you’re interested in all things World War II, the Lascaris War Rooms are made up of an underground network of rooms that used to serve as the strategic headquarters during the Second World War. This place was of critical importance during the war, serving as the advance Allied HQ and seeing General Eisenhower direct the Invasion of Sicily in 1943.

<span lang="en-US"><b>6. Domvs Romana</b></span>
The Domvs Romana was first discovered in 1881 and is located just between Rabat and the ancient walled city of Mdina. Here, you’ll find a Roman-era aristocratic house in ruins, dating back to around the 1st century BC. Countless well-preserved artefacts were found at the site, including statues, mosaics, tombstones and other remains.

You just can’t visit the Domvs Romana without hitting Mdina on the same day - they’re a short walk away from each other and the Silent City will have you enchanted from the moment you walk through its regal main gate.

One of the many impressive forts strategically dotted around the island, Fort St Elmo is located in Valletta and today serves as home to the National War Museum.

            [content] => "western" >The islands of Malta and Gozo are packed with history, culture and tradition, openly visible around villages and cities. However, there are some hidden gems worth viewing and visiting, but fair warning to you, dear reader- they’re not your typical tourist attractions!
"western"><strong>1. Secret Passage in St. Gregory’s Church</strong>
"western" >This Church, found within the outskirts of Zejtun, is officially known as St. Catherine’s Old Church, however, locals refer to it as St. Gregory’s for the village’s traditional yearly procession. This medieval church was built before 1436, however, its present edifice is a combination of Gothic and Romanesque architecture, dating back to the 16th century, therefore little remains of the original building. It looks like the typical Maltese church, however, a secret U-shaped passage was built within the church, containing a surprising amount of human bones. Legend has it that people were buried alive within these passages during the siege of 1614. Creepy.

"western"><strong>2. Mdina Underground Tunnel</strong>
"western" >Fun Fact: The Malta Railway was the only railway ever built on the island, and consisted of a single railway line running from Valletta to Mdina (about 8 miles). Operations started in 1883 but shortly ended in 1931<i> </i>due to high competition from the new bus transport system introduced in Malta. Nowadays the Mdina tunnel that served to operate the railroad was used for mushroom farming but is now totally abandoned. Grab your torches and your Dora the Explorer backpack and get ready for a day of spook and adventure!

"western"><strong>3. Victoria Lines</strong>
"western" >Unofficially (and ironically) referred to as the Great Wall of Malta, the Victoria lines are a line of fortifications that run 12 kilometers across the island, separating the northern and southern regions of Malta. These lines range from Madliena, Mosta, Mgarr, Rabat, and Mdina, and was to serve as a military mechanism to be used by the British military in the 19th century. It is said that the Victoria Lines were built as a consequence to the opening of the Suez Canal. In 1998, the Government of Malta submitted the building to UNESCO for consideration for World Heritage Site status. Go for a walk along the lines on a sunny spring day- the views are endless and magnificent!

"western"><strong>4. Malta Cart Tracks</strong>
"western" >These cart tracks can be found around the Maltese garigue countryside, however, the most popular example of the Cart Tracks would be the Clapham Junction Cart Ruts. These ruts are paired grooves within limestone, thought to have been used for the transportation of carts around the Maltese islands, however, strangely enough, they do not appear to be directly linked to the building of any of Malta’s megaliths. What’s most notable, and rather mysterious, about the Clapham Junction ruts is the fact that these ruts seem to go on underwater. What were they used for? Were they man-made, a geological feature, or were they made by extraterrestrials? The theories are plenty- time to go and form your own!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BaUYb_-gXWH/?tagged=cartruts/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western"><strong>5. Wied il-Ghasri</strong>
"western" >This valley can be found in Gozo, Malta’s sister island. The valley stretches from Ta’ Dbiegi Hill, all the way to Ghasri village, and goes on between Zebbug and Ta’ Gurdan Hill, where the valley narrows down into a stream of seawater, large enough for people to swim in. The stream eventually opens onto the big blue, where divers enjoy exploring surrounding underwater caves. A very interesting cave to spot is one with a shaft dug up towards the top of the cliffs above the bay, which was used to bring seawater to neighbouring saltpans with ropes and buckets. This valley is not only interesting, but aesthetically pleasing, and usually rather abandoned before peak season.

"western"><strong>6. Ahrax tal-Mellieha</strong>
"western" >This area includes a campsite (for the more outdoorsy of us) and also a dive site (for the more adventurous mermaids and mermen). To camp in the area, one needs to obtain a permit from the Mellieha Local Council, but after that, it is as easy as packing a bag and spending a night surrounded by spectacular views and, more notably, shooting stars- a truly different touristic experience. Alternatively, visit the diving site and snorkel around the coral reef and or dive through an underwater entrance to a large cave, yet it is advised to visit the cave with a professional diver.

            [content] => "western" >Short rental properties are terrific – you get a whole home away from home at the price of a hotel room, which is often a fraction of the size of a rental property. While renting a property, you can cook your own meals (thereby saving a substantial amount of cash), wash your clothes (so you won’t need to burden your suitcases with unnecessary clothing) and have a proper place to crash after days of exploring. <a href="http://www.shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Short Lets Malta</a> offers a wide range of rental properties to choose from – from cute 1-bedroom apartments in Sliema that won’t break the bank, to humongous villas in Mellieha which will make you feel like a celebrity. All the properties come fully furnished, readily equipped for a comfortable stay. Yet when living in any rental property for a prolonged period of time – say for two or five months – you might feel the need to make the place more ‘yours’; more personal. We’ve come up with 6 brilliant ways to spruce up your rental without creating any damages to the property, which however will transform your tenantable rental into a cosy home.

<ol>
	<li><strong>Buy fresh flowers and plants</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">This has to be the easiest tip of them all. Find your neighbourhood florist and buy some fresh flowers at the start of each week. The bright hues will liven up your space and lighten up your mood as well! Plants work just as well – they can bring life into lifeless spaces in your rental, such as your bathroom windowsill, or your laundry room. Succulents are easy to care for and come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so you will certainly find one that suits your tastes.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeIiqfrgL1O/?hl=enamp;taken-by=ericaaake/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Fluff up your place with soft furnishings</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">Spending money on soft furnishings may seem like an investment in your rental property; however, it is amazing how different an apartment can look and feel when dressed up with cosy blankets, throws, and cushions. Choose a theme for your rental (or go with the theme set by your landlord) and splurge a little on a comfy blanket and a couple of matching (or mismatching – it’s your call!) cushions. These will do wonders aesthetically while also serving a very useful purpose – keeping you comfortable and warm!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd-W4l_BQEo/?hl=enamp;tagged=cushions/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Rest photo or art frames on shelves or on the floor</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">When renting a property, one of the main rules is always: No Renovations. This means no holes in the walls, no painting, no wallpaper… you get the idea. And it does make sense, as the landlord needs to keep the space as blank a canvas as possible. Still, an artwork is an essential part of each room, and it allows you to express your individuality in your home. The best way to display artwork without breaking the ‘No Renovation’ rule is to rest your artwork on shelves, or on the floor. You might even discover your artistic side and start painting and exhibiting your own pieces!
"western">[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeulUc8hqUE/?hl=enamp;tagged=decor/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Embrace clip-on lights</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">In a space where you can’t commit to big pieces of furniture, clip-on lights are your friend! Add an extra source of light in your bedroom, or use clip-on lights above your desk for a new feature in your rental home that can easily be moved around and taken with you on check-out. Clip-on lights come in a variety of colours, and can be a quirky but useful prop in any room of your rental home.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BHy66s9hlcR/?hl=enamp;tagged=cliponlight/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Use your pretty luggage as storage!</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">Having nice pieces of luggage is essential when travelling (especially when it comes to recognising your suitcase in a sea of black and blue at the airport!), and it is a shame that these are put away during your stay. Get creative and use your funky luggage as storage in your rental home, giving you extra space to get rid of unsightly clutter while also putting them on display for everyone to see. Sturdy suitcases can also double as end tables when stacked on top of each other, giving your rental an eclectic feel!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BesyaM_Dfk6/?hl=enamp;tagged=suitcase/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong>Bring a few personal mementos from home</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">If you tend to feel homesick, especially on longer trips, a few knick-knacks from home will make your rental property feel more homely, while also sprucing it up. Personal mementos like photographs are cute reminders of fun times, and other personal items such as your favourite mug will help you feel at home even if you’re miles away. It is also always a good idea to bring your favourite book – it will give you something to read when you’re feeling homesick, and you can use it as part of your décor as well! These small trifles won’t take much space in your suitcase, but they will hold a special place in your heart and they’ll certainly bring some additional comfort to your rental home.

            [content] => Whether you’re thinking about visiting Malta for a well-deserved holiday this summer or just want to make this Mediterranean gem your home away from home for a little while, one of the first things you need to think about is where you want to stay. Malta may be a small island (with a very big personality, we might add), but when it comes to finding the right place for you to stay in, there are options to suit every taste, mood and season. Today we’re going to take a little whistle-stop tour of some of our favourite places right here in Malta – which one will you choose?

<strong>Valletta: The 2018 Capital of Culture</strong>

Our majestic capital city is a hotspot for all things cultural, historical and culinary, and home to some of the most incredible baroque architecture you’ll ever see. During the day, Valletta is a bustling centre of business, shopping, and quaint cafes just buzzing with the chatter of friends catching up over coffee or professionals on their lunch breaks. The city is filled with historical attractions to see, including the regal Biblioteka Nazzjonali (National Library), Saint John’s Co-Cathedral, the Lascaris War Rooms, the Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens, and Fort St. Elmo, to name just a few of our personal must-sees. As day fades into a sultry Mediterranean night, the city comes alive once more with countless cozy wine bars, welcoming cocktail lounges and top-quality restaurants for you to savour. Valletta really does have it all.

<strong>Mellieha and St. Paul’s Bay: The Beach Lover’s Haven</strong>

Mellieha and St. Paul’s Bay are two sun-seeker favourites that feel a world away from the hustle and bustle of life in central Malta. Perfect for the beach bunnies out there, you’ll be absolutely spoiled for choice when it comes to choosing which stretch of sandy beach you’ll visit each day, and the crystal blue sea is bound to wash away all your worldly worries the minute you splash into the water. Our favourite spots have to be Ghadira, Little Armier, Paradise Bay, Golden Bay, and Ghajn Tuffieha!

<b>Sliema and Gzira: The Dynamic Duo</b>

<span style="font-weight:400;">These two towns are ideal if you want to be at the heart of all the action and get to know the locals a little better! Sliema and Gzira may be next door neighbors, but they definitely have their own distinct personalities. Sliema is a shopping hotspot dotted with cute cafés and eateries to hit after a long day of retail therapy, while Gzira has that classic Maltese charm and a bit more of a laid-back vibe that Mediterranean people are known for. There are a couple of things these two places have in common: gorgeous seafront views across to the capital city, and a promenade perfect for morning jogs or evening walks! Oh, and as two very central towns, you’ll have great access to transport links here.</span>

            [content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">The Maltese Islands celebrate 14 holidays each year, falling into two categories: Public Holidays and National Holidays. Public Holidays commemorate mostly religious and social themes, while National Holidays recall patriotic themes, namely significant dates in Maltese history which helped change the course of the islands’ fate. National holidays help keep these historical events fresh in our minds, reminding us of the struggles our nation had to undergo to achieve the status it holds today. So, whether you’re new to the islands, or you’ve completely forgotten why we have so many off days throughout the year, we can help you better understand the importance of each National Holiday, and how you can join the celebrations.</span>

<b>31</b><b>st</b><b> March - Freedom Day</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Jum il-Ħelsien, or Freedom Day, is celebrated each 31</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> March, commemorating the same date in 1979 when the British troops and the Royal Navy withdrew their forces from the islands. For the first time in over a thousand years, Malta no longer served as a military station for a foreign power, making the archipelago truly independent, even though by law independence had been given 15 years before. The main events which are held on this day take place on the Freedom Day Monument in Vittoriosa, where wreaths of flowers are placed by Malta’s highest officials, as well as on the War Memorial in Floriana, where a similar ceremony takes place. A Regatta (a traditional Maltese boat race) is held in the afternoon in the Grand Harbour, where seven seaside towns compete for the coveted shield.</span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4196" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/sette-giugno.jpg" alt="Sette Giugno" width="684" height="456" />
<b>7</b><b>th</b><b> June – Sette Giugno</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The 7</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> June in Malta is known by its Italian name, Sette Giugno, and remembers the same day in 1919 when four Maltese patriots were killed by British troops. Following an ever-growing increase in the cost of living after the hardships of World War I, the Maltese started a series of riots and protests against the privileged few – which included the British colonial government - who were keeping the majority in poverty, refusing to raise wages to meet the sensational increase in the prices of everyday supplies. The four Maltese men who were killed during these riots in Valletta were Manwel Attard, Guze Bajada, Lorenzo Dyer and Carmelo Abela. These riots are considered as the first step towards Maltese Independence, a step which took almost fifty years to complete. During this National Holiday, wreaths are placed upon the monument commemorating these four fallen men, which lies in St George’s Square, Valletta.</span>

<b>8</b><b>th</b><b> September – Victory Day </b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September is one of the most important dates in Maltese history. It marks the end of three sieges against the islands, two of which were amongst the bloodiest sieges in history. The Great Siege of 1565 saw its end on the 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September, when Ottoman Troops retired in defeat after more than three months of Siege against the islands. The Siege of Valletta of 1800 marked the end of the French occupation of Malta, also on the 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September. The Siege of Malta during World War II also saw its end on this fateful day, when the Italian army withdrew their attacks in 1943, thus marking the end of World War II in the Maltese Islands. This momentous date also marks the feast of the birth of the Virgin Mary, a venerated feast on the Maltese Islands, celebrated as the village feast in Senglea, Naxxar, Mellieħa, and Xagħra, Gozo.</span>
<img class="alignnone  wp-image-4195" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/regatte.jpg" alt="Regatte" width="670" height="376" />
<span style="font-weight:400;">The 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September nowadays is mostly known for the traditional Regatta, held in the Grand Harbour. The towns of Cospicua, Vittoriosa, Senglea, Birzebbuga, Marsa, Valletta and Kalkara compete for the laudable shield, each hoping that their town’s name will be engraved as that year’s winner. The Armed Forces of Malta commemorate this day with an annual Parade along Republic Street in Valletta, a procession which ends at St John’s Co-Cathedral, in the presence of Malta’s highest officials.</span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4194" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/jum-l-indipendenza.jpg" alt="Jum l-Indipendenza" width="1024" height="683" />
<b>21</b><b>st</b><b> September – Independence Day</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Independence Day, or Jum l-Indipedenza as it is known in Maltese, commemorates the 21</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September 1964, when Malta gained Independence from the British. The British government had promised the Maltese their independence as a reward for the hardships the islands had to endure during the Second World War. Nearly twenty years after the end of the war, Malta finally became Independent, with the Maltese flag finally raised at the Independence Arena in Floriana on the night between the 20</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> and 21</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September 1964, among the cheer and delight of the Maltese population. Gorg Borg Olivier was elected first Prime Minister of the newly Independent Maltese Islands, inaugurating the festivities which were held on the day. Nowadays this historic day is commemorated by the placing of wreaths on the Independence Monument in Floriana. </span>
<b>13</b><b>th</b><b> December – Republic Day</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The 13</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> December of 1974 marks the date when the Maltese constitution was amended to remove the British Monarch as the head of the Maltese state, with its sovereignty being held by its own President. Sir Anthony Mamo was named Malta’s first President of the Republic, thus heralding an end to Queen Elizabeth II’s rule over the archipelago, a role that was still held despite Malta’s Independence ten years prior. This day is still remembered by various activities, mainly by the awarding of Ġieħ ir-Repubblika by the President of the Maltese Islands to citizens who deserve this highest honour. Wreaths are also placed upon the Republic Day Monument in Marsa, and a military parade is held in the main streets of Valletta. </span>

            [content] => <span lang="en-US">When you work hard, you deserve to play even harder - that’s why we do things like book holidays, treat ourselves to a bit of shopping, buy a new car, enjoy fancy dinners or cheeky days at the spa, isn’t it? If you’re visiting Malta this summer, rest and sun-soaked relaxation are the absolute order of the day </span><span lang="en-US"><b>every day </b></span><span lang="en-US">- no matter how long (or indeed short) your Mediterranean break might be. With a well-planned visit to this piece of Mediterranean heaven, you can bet that all your worldly worries will wash away like a single shell carried off by the gentle tides that kiss our sandy shores. To take that well-deserved self-indulgence to the next fabulous level, stay in a luxury villa! We know you probably don’t need much persuading about this bit, but </span><span lang="en-US"><i>just in case</i></span><span lang="en-US"> here are a few reasons to <a href="https://www.luxuryvillasmalta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rent a villa during your stay in Malta</a><!--  http://shortletsmalta.com/villas.html -->.</span>
<b>1. It’s cost-effective</b>
<span lang="en-US">Just because you’re treating yourself to this kind of luxury, it doesn’t mean you’ll have to break the bank! Villas can actually end up being far more cost-effective than staying at a hotel; get together with your nearest and dearest and watch the per-night price drop and drop again. You know what that means? A bigger cocktail budget. That’s what we like to see.</span>

<b>2. Feel right at home (away from home)</b>
<span lang="en-US">Renting a villa means having all the comforts of home - and more - with a level of privacy that you just don’t get with other accommodation options. At Shortlets, our villas are handpicked for their exceptional quality, gorgeous, Pinterest-worthy decor and range of facilities that’ll make you feel like you’ve just walked into your home away from home. Bliss.</span>

<b>3. Perfect poolside spots</b>
<span lang="en-US">You know how when you stay at a hotel, you have to jostle for the best poolside seats or wake up a little earlier than you’d like to just to secure a good sunbathing spot? Forget about that when you stay at a villa. You’ll have the perfect spot all day every day if you want it.</span>
<span lang="en-US">[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeDD0g5nZYX/?taken-by=shortletsmalta/ hidecaption=true width=720]</span>
<b>4. The best views</b>

<span lang="en-US">[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/-_b7quOE08/?taken-by=shortletsmalta/ hidecaption=true width=720]</span>
<b>5. Quality time together</b>
<span lang="en-US">When you stay at a villa with friends and/or family, you get to spend time together in a far more relaxed setting than you would back home. Without the stresses of day-to-day life on your minds, you’ll be able to live, laugh, and make priceless memories that’ll last a lifetime.</span>

"western" >If, like fine wines, you prefer the more sophisticated side of life, then this stunning apartment is the ideal abode for your Malta travels. Located in the European Capital of Culture 2018, in the gorgeous Valletta - which in itself is an open-air museum - this beautiful apartment is modernly decorated and consists of all the amenities you might need on your Malta holiday. With a magnificent sea view balconies overlooking the historic Grand Harbour, and situated above Valletta's old entrance - Victoria Gate - you'll feel right at home sipping fine Maltese wine and enjoying this eternal city. The apartment retains its Maltese charm through the traditional wooden balconies which flood the holiday home in natural light. You'll be at the heart of all cultural events, a perfect place to be for a truly enchanting holiday.

"western" >If you're in Malta on business, chances are you'd rather reside in the business district of the island - Sliema or St Julian’s. This 4-bedroom apartment in Sliema is at the heart of its business centre, while also enjoying a breath-taking view over the harbour towards Valletta. While life in Sliema resembles city life with its bustling businesses, its rush hour traffic and its many residents rushing to and fro, by night this town is transformed into an entertainment hub, with a myriad of bars opening their doors for after-work drinks, going on until the wee hours of the morning. This apartment is just the ticket - being close enough to Sliema centre that you can walk to any meeting, while also being far enough from the bars so that you can enjoy a good night's sleep. You truly get the best of both worlds, and while you're here on business, it would be a shame to just enjoy the business side of the town!

            [content] => "western" ><span style="font-size:large;">When one thinks of Gozo, Malta’s untainted sister island, one might quickly jump to thoughts of a villa or a farmhouse in the middle of a tranquil village, lounging by a pool, a trip to Maxokk (Gozo’s most sought after bakery, home of the Gozitan ftira) or Jessica’s Delights (a local cake shop found in Marsalforn)- basically, all things that spell R-E-L-A-X. And admittedly, for the purposes of relaxing, Gozo is definitely your one-stop shop. </span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;">However, what can this island offer for the more adventurous, free-spirited of us? Those who crave an adrenaline rush over a lazy nap in the sun? Don’t fret- Shortlets Malta has got you covered! From fun, to almost crazy, for amateurs to experts, these are the top 6 activities to try out in Gozo.</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>1. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-jeep-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gozo Jeep Tour</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">Forget the typical “Hop-On-Hop-Off” tourist bus, when you’re in Gozo, you want to feel every dent in the ground, every cool breeze on a hot summer’s day. Get your Gozo adventure started with an all-day Jeep Tour around Gozo, to discover the most beautifully hidden local gems, such as Qala, Belvedere, Ramla l-Hamra (Ramla Bay), Calypso’s Cave, the Salt Pans, Xlendi and many more. We wouldn’t normally say this but...get your selfie stick and go nuts!</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfS4IYtHr4r/?taken-by=gozo_photography/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>2. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-quad-bike-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rent a Quad Bike</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">Another way how to spice up your Gozo tour- rent a Quad Bike and follow your tour leader to Gozo’s most remote areas, like Ghasri Valley, Dwejra, Kercem Heights, Simar Valley and many more, whilst enjoying the thrill that nothing but a quad bike can give you. A “swim stop”, i.e. an occasion to stop by a bay for a quick dip in the sea, is also offered during the summer season. Grab a quad bike buddy and start your engines!</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfYY0MoA_3Z/?taken-at=246549639/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>3. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/sup-in-gozo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUP in Gozo</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">What’s Sup? (Get it? Yeah, me neither). SUP stands for Stand Up Paddleboarding, which is basically an excuse to fall into the water repeatedly during those hot summer days. Or not! Whether you want to take this water sport seriously, or make some great memories with family and friends, SUP is the way to go. Take the opportunity to soak in the views; from Ghasri to Dahlet Qorrot, sometimes ranging all the way to Comino, this sport/tour combination can take you places. A giant SUP is also available (can fit 5-8 people)! Bonus: you can even SUP at night! We did warn you that we can be adventurous.</span>

"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>4. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/kayaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kayaking in Gozo</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">Not only is the word “kayaking” fun to say (repeat it out loud ten times and you’ll get on my wavelength) but it is also fun to do! With so many beautiful bays in Gozo offering the most spectacular views, why not spend a day kayaking with an experienced guide/ instructor? Suitable for any level or expertise, this activity can take you around the shorelines of Gozo, or even to Comino and back. Get ready to get soaked!</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWmqdCGF3_8/?tagged=kayakinggozo/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>5. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/helicopter-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take a Helicopter Tour</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">It’s time to get your feet off the ground and soar high up in the sky, to see Gozo like you’ve never seen it before. Fly on the Robinson 44 and listen to the audio guide whilst you soar above the three islands- Malta, Gozo, and Comino- the 3-in-1 package you’ve been waiting for. Bonus: no need to bring your camera, or waste precious moments fiddling with your phone to grab the best photo- a video of the flight may also be taken upon request! Bon Voyage!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>6. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Scuba Diving</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">There’s no better way to experience Gozo: some say that the most beautiful scenery belonging to the Maltese Islands is found underwater! Whether you are certified or wanting to experience something new, this is THE occasion to explore Malta’s history like never before. Visit wrecks, reefs and underwater caves, and capture the beauty of Mediterranean marine life. The bays are safe, and sheltered- perfect for beginners and interesting for experts alike.</span>

"western"><u></u><strong>What is </strong>Isle<strong> of MTV?</strong>
"western" >Isle of MTV is Malta’s number one annual summer music festival organised by MTV Europe itself, where well-renowned music artists perform in front of thousands of people from all around the world. Before establishing itself in Malta in 2007, this festival was held in Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy. Therefore, this year will mark the 11th anniversary of Malta’s biggest open-air festival in its history! Big names that have participated in the Isle of MTV festival in the past include Maroon 5, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Will.I.Am, Wiz Khalifa, and DNCE.

"western" >Dimitri Thivaios and Michael Thivaios are the Greek/Belgian masterminds behind this chart-topping DJ Duo, ranking number 1 and number 2 consecutively in 2014, 2015, 2016 and again in 2017 on the Top 100 DJs List. They quickly rose to fame when they hosted Tomorrowland for the first time, and were given the go-ahead to make the anthem of the Tomorrowland Festival, “Tomorrow (Give in to the Night)”, featuring Dada Life and Tara McDonald.

Following that milestone, the duo went on to create other yearly anthems, such as “The Way we see the World” and “Tomorrow changed Today”, but their biggest hit was surely their 2014 single “Tremor”, featuring Martin Garrix. In 2015, their single “The Hum”, in collaboration with Ummet Ozcan, saw them reaching for the number 1 spot in Belgian singles charts, and winning them “Best Global Dj”, “Best Big Room DJ”, “Best Music Video” and earning them a Platinum record in their country.

            [content] => Malta's historic sites surely know how to pack a punch. They're ancient, they're beautiful, and some of them are downright spooky... Spooky, you might think? Yes, some of Malta's historical sites have some bloody backgrounds, some gory, gruesome details that are sometimes left out of the history books. Some of these spectral stories are based on popular legends, while some are proven to be true. Nevertheless, it is still fun to know some additional details about a historical site you're visiting, and you can amuse your friends with your new found knowledge about the sites. Ready to delve into the macabre mysteries that surround Malta's historical sites?
<strong>1. Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4239" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/hypogeum-2.png" alt="hypogeum 2" width="800" height="331" />
The Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni is a spine-tingling place to visit. Located underground (from the Greek hypo - meaning under, and geum - meaning earth), this shrine was discovered by accident: workers stumbled upon it while digging a well. A series of subterranean chambers was unearthed, winding down into the bowels of the earth. These stone carved rooms are as mind-boggling as they are impressive, and it remains a mystery as to how these primitive peoples could construct such an intricate structure underground. Yet the mystery continues to unravel. During a school trip to the Hypogeum in 1938 by a fourth-year class and their teacher, the whole class vanished. Having scrambled down to the third level of the temple (a level which is now closed to the public), these children and their teacher lost their way back, and never saw the light of day again. The people of the area swore they could hear children screaming for up to four days after their disappearance, yet these poor pupils were never found. This incident was reported in the National Geographic of 1940, and while the Maltese authorities try to dispel the above occurrence as a "myth" designed to "keep children out of these underground places", the truth may very well never be known.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4240" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/hypogeum.png" alt="hypogeum" width="1067" height="800" />
<strong>2. St Paul's Catacombs</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4245" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/st-pauls-catacombs-2.png" alt="st pauls catacombs 2" width="690" height="365" />
During Roman rule in Malta, burials inside the city walls were prohibited. Early Christianity was on the rise, especially after St Paul's visit, and these early Christians needed a place to bury their dead since Christianity dictated that the body would be resurrected just like the body of Christ at the end of times. Since they could not bury their dead in the Medina, they moved just outside the city walls and into the suburb of Rabat, where they constructed the earliest Christian tombs on the islands. These tombs were practically small interconnected hypogea, which spread, web-like underneath Rabat. What is creepy about these catacombs are the main halls, decorated with a large, circular and low-lying table; much like the tables, Roman homes used for dining. These early Christians used to gather here, near their dead, to pray and break bread, honouring their dead loved ones in commemorative rituals. These catacombs housed tombs for over 1000 people, making them the largest tombs of their kind on the island.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4244" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/st-pauls-catacombs-1.png" alt="st pauls catacombs 1" width="800" height="600" />
<strong>3. Mdina Dungeons</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-4242 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mdina-dungeons-1.png" alt="mdina dungeons 1" width="621" height="464" />
The dungeons beyond the ground level of the Magisterial Palace in Mdina are now notoriously known as the 'Mdina Dungeons', Malta's only dark walk attraction. The dungeons now portray different aspects of the horrors of Maltese life of the past - from the Roman era, when Malta was probably used as a slave colony, to the heavy hand rule during the time of the Knights of St John. The Romans were famously inhuman in their punishments, from beheadings to crucifixions; these were not people to be messed with! Fast-forward to the time of the Order of St John, punishments were still as harsh as ever, with the culmination being the establishment of the Inquisitor's office, whose aim was of suppressing heresy against the Catholic Church. This was done through a series of torture methods - but more on that below. The dungeons portray all the creative and imaginative ways that punishment was inflicted throughout Malta's history. While certainly not for the faint of heart, this attraction is an insight into the gore and gruesomeness that once dominated everyday life on the islands. It sure makes us glad to be alive during a time when all these atrocities have been abolished!
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4243" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mdina-dungeons-2.png" alt="mdina dungeons 2" width="1024" height="768" />
"western" ><strong>4. Inquisitor's Palace</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4246" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/inquisitor-2.png" alt="inquisitor 2" width="828" height="550" />
When you mention torture and punishment in Malta, the Inquisitor's Palace in Birgu comes to mind. After more than 500 years of its establishment, this imposing palace still manages to instill fear into the Maltese minds - exactly as it was meant to do all those years ago. The office of the Inquisitor was founded in Malta to put an end to heresy against the church, and this meant anything from witchcraft to blasphemy. The Palace excelled in extremely creative forms of corporal punishment - from the notorious 'bir tas-skieken' (well of knives - ouch!) to the 'stringitore', a wooden device which used to crush a victim's ankles. These methods of torture were mostly implemented during trials, at the sight of which most people pleaded guilty straight away. Some of the torture devices were pure figments of the Maltese imagination, and only two persons are known to have been killed at the palace - both of whom were burned alive (still ouch!). The aim of the Office of the Inquisitor was definitely met, as the mere mention of the place still manages to send shivers down the Maltese people's spines.

Ġbejna (Maltese pronunciation: [ˈd͡ʒbɛjnɐ], plural ġbejniet) are cheeselets typically made from sheep milk, salt, and rennet. They are prepared and served in a variety of forms: pickled, salted, peppered, covered in herbs, dried, or as a plain, fresh cheeselet. Trying a fresh Maltese ġbejna when visiting Malt is definitely a must!

Towers were built by the Knights of Malta and date back to the 17th century. Different features distinguish towers built by different Grand Masters. Location was strategically chosen so that each tower could view neighbouring towers. A firing signal was given from one tower to the next when enemies approached quickly alerting the whole Island.

            [content] => Corned Beef was a war-time food staple that people ate out of necessity. Yet it remained a favourite among people of all ages long after the war had ended. Part influenced by the colonial rule of the British, and part out of their sheer love of good food, the Maltese took on corned beef pie as a traditional dish, one which is still enjoyed in many a Maltese home to this day (although we can't quite grasp why corned beef is mostly known as <em>bulu beef</em> among the Maltese!)

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

2 large tins corned beef
1 small can tomato paste [about 120g]
4 large carrots, finely diced
1 large onion finely diced
8 very small potatoes, cooked and cut into 4 pieces
1 packet ready-made short crust pastry [500g]
3 tbsp vegetable oil
A little water

<strong>Method</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Heat the oil and add the carrots and onion and cook until carrots are soft. If necessary add a little water.</li>
	<li>Preheat the oven at 180°C.</li>
	<li>In the meantime cook the potatoes, do not cook them too much, you can boil, microwave or steam them. Cut them in 4 and set aside.</li>
	<li>When carrots amp; onion are cooked, add the corned beef and tomato paste. Give it a good stir and simmer for a couple of minutes until the corned beef smashes down.</li>
	<li>Stir well again and turn off the heat. Mash the potatoes and stir them in. Set the mixture aside.</li>

            [content] => Tarja Froġa is a Maltese pasta omelet, traditionally made with vermicelli. This dish was an ingenious way of bulking up freshly cooked pasta or turning leftovers into a second meal, as it comes together without much effort, but disappears just as fast!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-4026 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/tarja-froga-2.jpg" alt="tarja froga 2.jpg" width="684" height="1024" />

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

300grms Vermicelli Spaghetti
3 beaten eggs
5tbs grated cheese
seasoning (salt and pepper)
Olive Oil

<strong>Method</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Beat the eggs into a big bowl, add the cheese and seasoning</li>
	<li>Mix the cooked vermicelli</li>
	<li>Put a little olive oil in a frying pan, and spread the contents of the bowl in it.</li>
	<li>Fry on a low heat till its golden brown and crispy on both sides.</li>
	<li>Serve piping hot!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tip!</strong> - Be careful when turning over the froġa, if it's not cooked enough it will end up breaking up while turning. You can use a plate to help you flip it over.

"western" >In an age when social media and gadgets dominate every sector of life, it’s difficult to put down your phone, and consequently, shut off your brain. Truthfully, at Shortlets Malta, we highly encourage your selfie-ing and facebook-ing (I mean, we love social media too!), however, we also encourage a well-deserved scrolling break for your thumb, from time to time.

"western" >Gone are the days when “me time” meant reading for hours on end, breathing in the scent of the old yellow sheets of paper, crying over the death of our favourite hero. Instead, “me time” became scrolling through Instagram, wonder what Kylie Jenner is up to next, and crying over the death of our favourite Game of Thrones character.

"western" >So here we are, trying to combine our many loves - our love of Malta, our love of travelling, our love of relaxing, and our love for books. These are the top 5 books about Malta, that you have to read before, during and after your stay in Malta (especially for when the after-holiday blues hit!):
"western" ><b>1. In the Name of The Prince: Maltese Corsairs 1760-1798, by Liam Gauci: </b>Gauci’s book narrates the tales and trials of the Corsairs, who were, in fact, not pirates, but worked within a completely legal framework to plunder and pillage goods, gold, and rum belonging to neighbouring lands, including Malta. This was done via an increasingly sought after the letter of marque issued in the name of the Prince and the Grand Master of Malta. Immerse yourself in the world of the Maltese Corsair, and read all about this forgotten legacy.

"western"  align="CENTER"><b>2. Two, by Teodor Reljic: </b>Elizabeth, on her annual Malta holiday, suffers a heart attack and slips into a deep coma, to her family’s dismay. With no hope of recovery, her son William is desperate- surrounded by the grief and despair of his family members. Yet William’s mother left him something vital, hidden deep within his childhood; stories about a young boy named Vermillion, who lived between two hills in a distant land (sounds familiar?). A stranger appears in his life, a stranger who knows more about Elizabeth than any stranger should. Could he be the one to give William the answers he is looking for?

"western"  align="CENTER"><b>3. The Kappillan of Malta, by Nicholas Monsarrat: </b>Set in World War II Malta, this is the riveting tale of Father Salvatore, a priest who had vowed to take care of the poor of the island. He tends to the ones left homeless, frightened, hungry and vulnerable by the war, whilst wrestling with his personal inner conflicts. Get familiar with Malta’s history through this enchanting book, you might even end up being your own tour guide!

"western"  align="CENTER"><b>4. Il Colore del Sole, by Andrea Camilleri: </b>this one is for our Italian fans; whoever is familiar with Andrea Camilleri’s works is probably also familiar with our favourite Inspector Montalbano. Yet in this particular novel, Camilleri is our hero. During his travels in Siracusa, our author, not being able to resist a mystery, finds himself in possession of old, jumbled up notes, presumably forming part of a diary kept by Caravaggio himself during his time in Sicily and Malta. Beautifully written, as always; this book is a must-read!

"western"  align="CENTER"><b>5. The Information Officer, by Mark Mills: </b>Another spectacular read for those enchanted by Malta’s trials during World War II, Mills’ novel is set in 1942 when aerial bombardment was rife and relations between the British Empire and the island were spreading thin. The murder of a local girl spurs our hero, Max Chadwick, to look into what really happened, whilst struggling to keep the locals’ (and his) moral high. This novel is laden with information about Malta during the war, yet it thrives as an enthralling novel with deeply complex characters.

"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Going on holiday can be a stressful event, which is ironic – since holidays are meant to be a relaxing experience. Yet with all the packing, flights, accommodation, sight-seeing… a holiday can feel like tons of work. We gathered some travelling tips and tricks to make your journey, arrival and stay a pleasant and smooth-sailing experience, not one you’d need another vacation to recover from!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #1 Book a rental property for your vacation</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4297" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt2.jpg" alt="tt2" width="797" height="532" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Let’s face it, hotels are ridiculously overpriced, and you’re generally stuck in a bland, square, cookie-cutter room that’s far less impressive than the photos you saw online. When you’re travelling for a long stretch of time, a hotel room can seem suffocating and very limiting. Booking a rental property on the other hand, gives you plenty of space (especially great if you’re on a family holiday and have kids tagging along), and gives you the freedom only a home can give: you can cook, you can wash your clothes, you can invite your newly made friends over without it being too cramped… you’re basically renting a home away from home, and at a much cheaper price than a hotel room too!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #2 Leave your guidebooks at home</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4296" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt3.jpg" alt="tt3" width="1379" height="488" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">While we do suggest that you do some reading about the location you’ll be visiting, we strongly recommend leaving your guidebook behind and just winging it. Chances are, the locals will be more than happy to help you find your way around, and they might even show you some really cool aspects of the location you’re visiting – aspects you won’t find in guidebooks. Whether it’s the best place to get cocktails on happy hour, or the best location to view the sunset – locals do know best. So let your adventurous side take over and ditch the guides. </span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #3 Pack less</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4295" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt4.jpg" alt="tt4" width="1379" height="920" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">This is particularly helpful if you’re following tip #1. Staying in a vacation rental provides you with your very own washing machine, a very handy tool to use when you want to avoid those nasty overweight fees at the airport. Pack the basics, and pack less than you think you need. You’ll travel lighter (no grunting while hauling your luggage onto the overhead compartment), and you’ll have more space for knickknacks and souvenirs! Also, make sure to roll your clothes rather than fold them, rolling takes much less space. And make good use of your items; for example, even though shoes are a bulky item to pack, they’re hollow! The inside of your shoe is a great place to tuck away your bits and bobs without any fear of damage or tangling!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #4 Eat like a local</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4294" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt5.jpg" alt="tt5" width="1379" height="925" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Sure you’ll get bombarded with restaurants as soon as you hit a famous landmark, but do you really want to eat where the tourists eat? Chances are the food will be tasteless and frustratingly overpriced, making you feel like you’ve been ripped off and generally ruining your holiday vibe. Stroll a few blocks down, mingle with the local scene (see Tip #2) and run a Tripadvisor search on the restaurants which catch your eye. Also, don’t forget to check out your corner grocery shop or fruit stall, for some quick and easy go-to snacks which you will desperately need after hours of sightseeing. Looking for an extra challenge? Try to learn the names of fruits and vegetables in the local language and impress the shop staff with your newly acquired knowledge!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #5 Find free WIFI hotspots</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4293" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt6.jpg" alt="tt6" width="1379" height="920" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Data roaming charges can truly skyrocket your expenses while on holiday (depending where you’re visiting), so make use of every free WIFI hotspot you encounter. Don’t be shy of asking restaurant and bar staff for the WIFI password either – they will be happy to oblige. Holiday rental properties generally come with free WIFI included too, meaning you can plan your itinerary for the day on Google Maps before you actually start your day. Make sure to download maps for offline use too – just say ok Google when you’ve found your route. It’ll be much easier navigating through an unknown street with easy access to your map. </span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #6 Use your accommodation TV as a phone charger</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4292" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt7.jpg" alt="tt7" width="1379" height="913" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">There is NOTHING worse than having your phone battery die on you – and that is a hundred times worse if you’re stuck with a dead battery while abroad. If you and your significant other are battling it out on who gets to charge their phone on the one charger you’ve brought with you – outsmart them. Bring a USB cable and plug your phone to the TV! Most LCD TVs come with a USB port at the back, making the TV an ideal charging station for your phone without having to figure out if your plug fits the local sockets. Charge your phone during the night for full battery potential on your sightseeing, and wave goodbye to that dreaded 0% battery!</span>

            [content] => "western" >Malta is a history lover's paradise. This island has attracted a variety of ancient populations, each of whom left their mark on its stones. While some of these remains are quite known to the public and are visited regularly by tourists and locals, there are other sites which seem to lie low on travellers' radars. Yet these historical locations are still significant and are perfect to visit if you’re in Malta for a longer period of time. Today, we delve into four lesser known sites to explore their unique features and the impact they left on the island.

<b>Skorba Temple</b>
"western" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4303" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/skorba-temple.jpg" alt="Skorba Temple" width="1200" height="787" />The temple at Skorba is one of the smallest temple structures found in Malta. This ancient site is located in Zebbiegh, limits of Mgarr, amidst a sea of fields and rolling hills. The landscape here has not changed much from how it was at the time of the temple builders and gives us a better perspective of what the temple builders actually saw and experienced during their time. The earliest remains found in this structure date back to over 4000 B.C., meaning that this area had been inhabited very early on in our island's history.  What remains of the temple are mostly upright stones known as megaliths, as well as foundation stones which show us how the temple might have looked like. The remains found at this site were of unique importance to archaeologists, with the most recognisable being a terracotta figure of the mother goddess, which can now be found at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta.

"western" ><b>Ta' Hagrat Temple</b>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-4305 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ta-hagrat-temple.jpg" alt="Ta Hagrat Temple" width="500" height="350" />
The temple at Ta' Hagrat can also be found in the same area as Skorba, in the small village of Mgarr. Ta' Hagrat is also on the smaller side, yet it is a beautifully preserved temple which still retains much of its original structure. This temple is easily recognisable due to its monumental doorway, which was reconstructed in 1937 using its original lintel. The doorway is instantly distinguishable as it includes a three-step entryway, a feature which is rarely seen in other temple sites. Both Ta' Hagrat and Skorba temples are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, due to their ancient age and historical significance. These temples are some of the lesser known among Malta’s vast network of ancient sites; however, they are worth a visit to truly appreciate their beauty.

Visiting hours: Monday to Sunday: 09.00 - 17.00hrs

<b>Ta’ Bistra Catacombs</b>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4304" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ta-bistra-catacombs.jpg" alt="Ta' Bistra Catacombs" width="709" height="487" />
Ta' Bistra Catacombs, located in the town of Mosta, are the largest network of underground tombs outside of the Mdina/Rabat area found in Malta so far. These catacombs date back to the 4th Century AD, when Malta was slowly being converted to Christianity. Marvelously preserved, these catacombs are now one of the most accessible sites in Malta, with ramps allowing for wheelchair and pushchair access, as well as an interactive visitor's centre with audio-visual information about the tombs. While certainly not as known as the catacombs in Rabat, this newly refurbished heritage site shines a new light on life (and death) during the early stages of Christianity on the island.

Visiting hours: Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturdays between 09.00 and 17.00hrs
Last admission is at 16.30hrs
Closed on 24, 25 amp; 31 December, 1 January amp; Good Friday
"western" ><b>Fort Rinella</b>
"western" ><img class=" size-full wp-image-4301 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fort-rinella.jpg" alt="Fort Rinella" width="582" height="389" />
The Rinella Battery in Kalkara dates back to the Victorian era, when Malta was under British rule. This site was never used as a fort during its time, yet the name Fort Rinella stuck. In this site, one can find one of the two surviving Armstrong 100-ton guns - a mammoth weapon which is bewildering to behold even today. Rinella was one of two batteries containing such guns - the other gun which used to be at Cambridge battery near Tigne Point has been lost. This site is worth a visit for its historical re-enactments by Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna, where actors dressed as 19th Century British soldiers provide regular tours as well as reconstructions of battles of the era using weapons of that period. There is also a fantastic audio-visual experience and visitors can also get a chance to be part of the re-enactment itself. Fancy firing a Victorian rifle, anyone?

Visiting hours: Fort Rinella is open Mon - Sat from 10.00 till 17.00hrs.
Closed<b> </b>on New Year's Eve, New Year, Good Friday, Easter, Santa Marija 15 August, Christmas Eve and Christmas.

            [content] => "western" >Before visiting Malta, you will undoubtedly have done some research – places to visit, historical sites to see and so forth. In your search you will have come across a massive but quite plain looking church, located in the middle of Valletta, the European City of Culture 2018. St John’s Co-Cathedral should definitely be on your ‘must-see’ list, even if churches aren’t usually on your holiday itinerary. This is not your regular, run of the mill church: this Co-Cathedral is a spectacular example of Baroque art, in all its pompous glory.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfG-K3YA9Qe/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western">Getting there
"western" >Valletta is Malta’s best connected city, with almost all buses on the island ending their trip there. Finding a bus to Valletta is easy – check out the bus stops in your area, and find the ones which have Valletta as their destination (quick tip, if you can’t manage to find it on one side of the street, try the other side!) If you’re living in Sliema, you can also get a ferry to Valletta, which also gives you a lovely little tour around the Harbour. Driving to Valletta can be a bit tricky, as parking within the city can be difficult, not to mention expensive. If you’re renting a car, you can park at the car park in Floriana, giving you easy access to the city while ensuring that your car is parked safely. As soon as you reach City Gate, reaching the Co-Cathedral is easy. Walk down Republic Street until you reach a crossroads, with a green kiosk selling flowers on your right. Turn right at this kiosk, and you’ll be able to behold the imposing structure of the church before you. It is essential to take a look at the Co-Cathedral before entering, as you’ll see a stark contrast from the outside to the inside.

"western" >In order to reach the visitor’s entrance, head back to Republic Street, walk slightly further up, and you’ll see the law court (huge Greek temple-style building) on your left. The visitor’s entrance will be on your right!

"western">The Interior
"western" >Upon entering, your eyes will need to adjust to the sheer number of embellishments found in the entrails of this church. There is something to see everywhere you look: from the marble tombs which cover the floor, to the gilded carvings of flowers, plants and angels on all the walls, to the marvellous fresco ceiling. The Co-Cathedral is dedicated to St John the Baptist, who was the patron saint of the Order of St John. Built in 1577 following the design of the famed Maltese architect Glormu Cassar, it was originally simply decorated, matching its exterior much more than it does today. The exterior was constructed to look like a fortress, plain and sturdy, withstanding attacks. During the seventeenth century, when the flamboyant Baroque style came to fashion, Grand Master Cotoner ordered a complete redecoration of the interior. He commissioned the renowned Italian artist Mattia Preti, who transformed the Co-Cathedral into the masterpiece we can still witness to this day.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgbpSfrA91p/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Preti revamped the vaulted ceiling, and used it as a canvas for his depiction of the life of St John the Baptist, using illusionary effects which gave the impression that the ceiling was much more elaborate than it actually was. With his skilful use of colour, Preti created a masterpiece of illusionistic effects. The carvings on the walls were also perpetrated by this Calabrian artist, transforming what was once bare stone into a cornucopia of golden flowers and plants. The side chapels of the Cathedral were designated to the different languages of the Order, much like they each had their own auberge. These chapels are also lavishly decorated, and some contain some of the most impressive funereal memorials to the Grand Masters, most of which were done by Mattia Preti himself. One of the most impressive of these monuments is, befittingly, the monument to Grand Master Cotoner, which encapsulates his chivalry and military prowess in marble. This memorial can be found in the chapel of Aragon, on the opposite side of the visitor’s entrance.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdkDYEkA6iF/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Also worth noticing is the copiousness of tombstones on the floor of this artistic masterpiece. Inlaid with Latin inscriptions and a variety of symbols, these marble tombs are a unique feature of this Co-Cathedral, telling each Knight’s story in a distinctive way.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf8XGG4jCL-/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >The sanctuary, being the focal point of the church, is also elaborately decorated, and features a stunning sculpture depicting the baptism of Christ, by the Italian sculptor Giuseppe Mazzoli. The white marble statues depicting Jesus Christ and his cousin are worked in the traditional Baroque style, giving movement to the sculpture. The central nave can now also be viewed from above, thanks to the restoration of the balcony which lies above the main door. This impressive gallery was restored recently, and is now open to the public.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgyD1JHHl-k/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Last but not least, in the Oratory which is located to the right of the main door, lie the magnificent paintings by Caravaggio. Michelangelo Merisi, better known as Caravaggio, graced the church with two paintings: one depicting Saint Jerome, and the altar piece showing the beheading of St John the Baptist. Both paintings display the artist’s expert use of the chiaroscuro effect as well as his harsh realism, and are both masterpieces in their own right. The painting portraying the beheading is the largest painting attributed to the artist, and the only one known to be signed. Caravaggio’s signature can be spotted underneath the pool of blood forming under the Saint’s head. This work of genius by itself is worth a visit to this Cathedral.

            [content] => "western" >The magical thing about living in Malta is that history is always just around the corner. Whether you’re strolling down the streets of Valletta, wandering around Mdina, or marvelling at some of the oldest man-made structures in the world, history surrounds you everywhere you go. Xemxija, although mostly known for being a quaint seaside town with a good variety of restaurants, was once an important spot for ancient civilisations, and an astonishing amount of historical sites can be found concentrated in what is now called the Xemxija Heritage Trail; what once was known as the Roman Road. This road also became known as the Pilgrims’ Way, as devout pilgrims travelled by this road to reach the famed sanctuary dedicated to Our Lady in Mellieha, usually after the fulfilment of a vow.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgqu49KHIlw/?hl=enamp;taken-by=peacebloom12/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western">The trail is easily found on Google Maps:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4356" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/map.png" alt="map" width="838" height="471" />
"western" >And i<span lang="mt-MT">t’</span>s very easy to follow. The road leading up to the start of the trail is <i>quite</i> the climb, but I can assure you, it’s totally worth the effort. At the beginning of the trail, you set foot on an uneven country road, flanked by an ancient Roman wall on the left side which is around 2000 years old. A lovely feature along this trail are the various information placards about different plant species – a thoughtful touch which will help you recognise the types of plants you’ll meet along the way. Slightly further up, another piece of history stands tall and proud – a prehistoric menhir (a large, standing stone) looms towards the sky, and is thought to be related to the burial rites during the Bronze Age (that’s roughly 2000BC). Right next to this imposing stone, uneven, rock-hewn steps lead into the first cavern: the Cave of the Galley (G<span lang="mt-MT">ħar ix-Xini). This cave was used as a human dwelling until some seventy years ago, even though it dates back even to Neolithic times. The cave is a welcome place to catch your breath after the climb to the start of the trail, and sweeping views over the Xemxija valley can be seen from its entrance.</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgqvHVtHzNm/?hl=enamp;taken-by=peacebloom12/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">Further up along the trail, on the right hand side, some more stone steps lead onto an open courtyard-like space, the whole left wall of which is occupied by </span>an apiary dating back to Roman times – scores of little niches carved into the rock, where bees would have been kept in order to produce the honey Malta was so known for. This beautiful space is flanked by stone benches overlooking the gorgeous Xemxija Bay – one can only imagine how breath-taking this scene must have looked before the rise of modern buildings. The apiaries are fully accessible and easily explored – a small doorway (mind your head, this door is super low!) leads into a longish stone-carved room, where ancient Romans harvested their honey. The details carved into the rock show the skill and craftsmanship of this ancient people. There are two apiaries, side by side, and both are free for anyone to explore!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgqvT8bHVNy/?hl=enamp;taken-by=peacebloom12/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Towards the right hand side of the apiaries, a stone staircase leads to the upper level: here a large cave lies above, its mouth wide open like a hungry animal. From the carved plaque one can see that this is the Burial Cave (G<span lang="mt-MT">ħar il-Midfna), a resting place for ancient remains. The cave itself is easily accessed and includes some interesting shelves cleaved out of the rock. The view from this cave is also spectacular, and the cavern itself exudes a sense of calm. Walking straight on from the cave, a large and wise-looking tree spreads out. This is the oldest living carob tree in Malta, believed to be around 1000 years old. The roots of this tree are a web of tangles, scurrying over one-another in knots and twists. Two plaques lie at the base of the tree, a poem written by Frans Scerri in 1999 – one plaque bears the poem in Maltese, and the other in English.</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgqvt4kH616/?hl=enamp;taken-by=peacebloom12/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">The roots of the ancient carob become makeshift steps onto the next level, where another apiary can be found. This rock-carved beehive is known as the Rustic Apiary, and once you step into its dark interior, it becomes clear why. This apiary was decorated using a rubble wall, going all the way up to the ceiling. Parts of this rubble wall were formed as arches, creating quaint ancient niches. This Rustic cavern is also significantly larger than the other two, and it is easy to imagine this space bustling with ancient life. Stepping out from the darkness inside the cavern and back down the alternative root steps, the trail winds upwards, past the aforementioned Burial Cave. Towards the right-hand side, past a small megalith framing the entryway, a Punic tomb dating back to 5000BC can be seen. While this tomb is not accessible as it lies in a pit, an informative plaque helps to answer some questions. Going further along, past the Punic tomb, one finds a further two caves, as well as an old farmhouse. These caves were used as dwellings in ancient times, with one cave being used by the parents, the other by their children, and the farmhouse was used for keeping their animals. Helpful plaques shed light on the ancient history of these dwellings. Crossing onto a modern road, then going further down, you’ll come across the Roman baths – beautifully built structures which were used as public bathhouses during the time of the Romans. They sure chose a stunning location!</span>

"western" ><a name="_GoBack"></a><span lang="mt-MT">This trail is truly an experience in itself, and the best thing is: it’s totally free! That’s right, you get to wander around, touch, crawl into and live out these ancient sites at NO cost at all. The Xemxija Heritage Trail is a hiker’s paradise, and a history buff’s dream – there are literally historic sites round every corner, each bearing their own story. While i do encourage you to visit this trail and explore the heck out of it, please respect Mother Nature, and keep this area as you found it. Trash cans are hard to come by along this trail, so taking a small garbage bag with you for your trash would be best. Areas like these are a treasure to our heritage, and without preservation they would be lost to time. Make the most of being on an island as jam-packed with history as Malta is, and experience her ancient roots for yourself!</span>

            [content] => <span lang="en-US">Thinking about visiting Malta in the spring? Well if you’re not you definitely should be! Experiencing the island around this time of the year means that you’ll be in for a Mediterranean treat. The Maltese spring is generally warmer than most, and there’s a pretty solid chance you’ll see many of the locals jumping at the chance to hit the beach, top up their tans, and splash around in our crystal-blue seas. Let’s take a closer look at why visiting Malta in spring is a fabulous idea:</span>
<span lang="en-US"><b>1. Awesome weather </b></span>
<span lang="en-US">If you love sunny weather but can’t take the full-on summer heat, this season is the perfect compromise. With temperatures usually hanging around the 17-to-25 degree mark, April and May are spot on. From lazy days at the beach to trekking, horse riding, kayaking and beyond, you will be able to enjoy everything the island has to offer without feeling like a sweaty mess at the end of it all. Win-win! </span>

<span lang="en-US"><b>2. Avoid peak season </b></span>
<span lang="en-US">When you book that well-deserved break during the low season, then you avoid peak-season prices too. Who </span><span lang="en-US"><i>does </i></span><span lang="en-US">like getting a great deal on their holidays?

<span lang="en-US"><b>3. Gorgeous scenery </b></span>
<span lang="en-US">The Maltese countryside is certainly beautiful all year round, but there’s always something special about the way things burst into life during springtime. Fiery sunsets, rugged walking trails, lush greenery, historic sights, breathtaking beaches - we have it all. If you’re not sure where to go to see Malta at its best, don’t worry! We’ve got a few suggestions on hand to get you started:</span>

            [content] => Caponata,  a Sicilian and also a Maltese Dish must not be confused with the French Ratatouille.  Both use aubergine, but Caponata is flavored with sugar and vinegar whilst in Ratatouille, these ingredients do not feature.  Although Sicilian, in Malta, Kapunata is very popular especially in the hot summer months when eaten chilled with fresh crusty maltese bread.
There are many ways to serve Kapunata, on its own,  as a side dish with fresh fish especially, as a pasta sauce or glamorize it a bit and serve it with risotto milanese and parmesan crisps as a dinner party starter.
There are many recipes for Kapunata, and below you will find one of the Maltese versions:
<div class="recipe-top">
<div class="recipe-info">
<h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>

            [content] => Planning a family trip is never an easy feat, especially when young children are involved. The little ones are more easily irritated and can get grumpy really quickly, so you need to find ways to keep them entertained and avoid those dreaded tantrums! Most families on holiday have found that staying at a <a href="http://www.shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental home</a> works much better for them than staying at a hotel – rental properties have all the amenities of an actual home, meaning you can prepare home-cooked meals (especially handy when you have small children) and kids still have a ‘household’ structure, instead of being confined to a room. Yet, it is a well-known fact that children get bored terribly quickly, so keeping them occupied and happy is a priority. We’ve listed 9 fun and engaging activities that your kids will love while on a family holiday to Malta which you can add to your vacation bucket list:

	<li><b>Visit the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Lagoon</a></b></li>

A family trip to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comino</a> is a must while in Malta. The smallest island is home to the clearest sea in the Mediterranean, and your kids will absolutely love it. It might actually be hard to tear them apart from the turquoise waters … but you can entice their sense of adventure with a:

	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-jeep-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeep Ride in Gozo</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhYzoFKHKty/?hl=enamp;taken-at=246549639
Gozo is the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago, and it is by far the prettiest. With rolling green hills and beautiful seaviews all around the island, it is a nature lover’s paradise. It is awesome for kids too, especially when touring it atop a Jeep! The ride itself will be a fun experience for your children, while the places of interest will appeal to both adults and kids alike.

<ol start="3">
	<li><b>Compare your height to the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/prehistoric-temples-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temples’ stones</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/8ln3LBRnWu/?hl=enamp;taken-at=237187112
The <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/prehistoric-temples-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temples</a> of Hagar Qim and Mnajdra in Malta, as well as the temple of Ggantija in Gozo are known for their imposing size. Your children’s imagination will run wild trying to make sense of the huge stones and circular rooms in each temple. It would also be a fun family photo opportunity to take a photo beside the largest stone, comparing your height to the massive boulders. You can also compare your photo with how tall your kids have become on your next trip to Malta!

<ol start="4">
	<li><b>Throw a coin in the Triton Fountain</b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhLn92BH9OI/?hl=enamp;tagged=tritonfountain
We get it, it’s no Trevi Fountain, yet the newly refurbished Triton Fountain at Valletta’s entrance is still a fun little area to explore with kids. The square has been pedestrianised, so even the younger children can run around freely. Make sure to drop a coin and make a wish in the fountain with your family!

<ol start="5">
	<li><b>Watch the sunset at Golden Bay on <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horseback</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAUxsCnznq/?hl=enamp;tagged=goldenbayhorseriding
This is especially fun for older children, who are generally even harder to please. Watching the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sunset at Golden Bay</a> is a must while on the island, and experiencing this wonderful time of the day on horseback is even more magical. #islandlife

<ol start="6">
	<li><b>Swim with the dolphins at <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/mediterraneo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mediterraneo Waterpark</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BWpUitelt8U/?hl=enamp;tagged=mediterraneomalta
Older and younger kids alike will be thrilled at the chance of swimming and interacting with dolphins and other sea creatures at the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/mediterraneo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mediterraneo water park</a>. Make sure to book this activity in advance to secure a spot, and take a video of the whole experience so they can relive it for years to come!

<ol start="7">
	<li><b>Spot a ghost on the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valletta ghost tour</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNnHD7-A-FS/?hl=enamp;tagged=vallettanight
This is another activity which older kids will surely enjoy. Book a ghost tour of Valletta and wander the historic city streets in the cover of night, while listening to some truly spooky tales of unquiet souls and restless spirits. Spine-tingling fun guaranteed!

<ol start="8">
	<li><b>Dress up and visit a Maltese festa</b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/4fMhJPtNtp/?hl=enamp;tagged=sannikola
When you visit Malta during the summer, you are sure to find a festa to visit every weekend. Do some research and find out which festa will be happening during your stay, then do as the Maltese do: don some fancy clothes, and take your family to the festa. You and your kids will experience a myriad of sounds and sights, making this activity one not to be missed!

<ol start="9">
	<li><b>Eat pastizzi</b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhQSe32A-N-/?hl=enamp;tagged=pastizzi
Ah, the classic Maltese snack! Pastizzi are a delicious snack made of puff pastry and a filling of either ricotta or peas. The simplicity of this snack is sure to go down well with kids, yet adults will love eating pastizzi just as much. There are now even pastizzi filled with Nutella – just in case you wanted to have pastizzi for dessert too! (We don’t recommend showing this version to your kids, or they won’t want to eat anything else!)

            [content] => The yearly tradition dictates that one should work towards a summer body during winter, yet work on a winter body in summer. Insulation is a must, and here at Shortlets Malta, we strive to help you in any way we possibly can (because we care, we really do). So here are the top 5 desserts to help you achieve that extra junk in the trunk, and where to find them:
<b>Milshakes at JAR, The Point, or The Plaza, Sliema: </b>
This milkshake is NOT for the faint hearted - it is rich, chocolatey, thick and oh so full of flavour. And speaking of flavours… what a variety! Featuring: childhood favourites like Cadbury and Kinder, aptly-named Caramel Bombs and Oreo shakes, and even The Healthy One for those of us who don’t want to induce a personal guilt-trip post-shake...there’s literally something for everyone. Feeling feisty? Try out their new Pina Colada shake for some extra buzz in your shake.

<b>Pancakes at Shoreditch Bar and Kitchen, Paceville: </b>
WARNING: once you read this particular post, you can never go back to enjoying a simple pancake. Ever. Not only has the team at Shoreditch Bar and Kitchen perfected the affordable gourmet burger, but they’ve also tempted us further into their homemade “sin of all sins” ; the ultra-famous, ultra-sought after Shoreditch Pancake Stack. Take your pick: are you a white chocolate lover? Try the new kitkat white pancake! Or maybe, you’re more of a classic milk chocolate kind of person…the Lindt Lindor pancake is just your thing! Seeing red? Go for the Red Velvet Pancake! The choice is honestly endless. Shortlets Malta suggests: bring friends so you can go halfsies on every pancake and try them all! <u><b></b></u>

<b>Doughnuts at Crust, St Julians: </b>
This new deli bakery prides itself on the fact that everything they serve is baked fresh, daily. The ambience is modern, unique and stylish, the savouries are to die for, but the real star of the entire enterprise is The Doughnut. With fillings such as pistachio, strawberry, cherry and cranberry, Nutella, coconut and kinder Bueno, it is hard to resist these babies. Try one, or try them all (in one sitting) and your taste buds will thank you forever.

<b>French Toast at Manouche, Craft Bakery and Bistro, St Julians: </b>
This new and very aesthetically appealing bakery is perfect for an afternoon treat after a day by the beach. Apart from a delicious breakfast menu, Manouche boasts of the best French Toast on the island, and no one dares contest it! Their Pain Perdu (a.k.a French Toast) is made with a unique, organic wheat brioche, brûlée banana, roasted peanut butter, Canadian maple syrup amp; vanilla creme fraiche; and it is a treat for the stomach, as well for the eyes.

<b>Sticky Toffee Pudding, Fat Louie’s, Paceville: </b>
A timeless, classic masterpiece: Fat Louie’s is known for its successful experimentation with regards to different variations of cuisine, yet the team hit a soft spot when adding the sticky toffee pudding to the list of desserts. Its moist, soft texture paired with a sticky pool of toffee, accompanied with soft-serve ice cream: a true symphony of warm and cold paired with rich, enticing, yet comforting flavour. This is the dessert to have after any of their main dishes.

            [content] => Whether you’re planning and booking a well-deserved mini-break or organising the round-the-world adventure of your dreams, knowing where you’re going to rest your weary feet and recharge after another action-packed day is often a top priority for travellers and tourists alike. Opting for <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/all_properties_menu.html"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>short-let accommodation in Malta</u></span></a> is a great, cost-effective way to make sure you find your home away from home with more privacy and independence than other accommodation types would typically offer.
But what should you look for when you’re doing that all-important research? Let’s take a quick look at some key points for you to consider:
<b>1. Range </b>
It’s nice to be spoiled for choice, isn’t it? When you’re looking at potential providers, take a look at what types of properties are available <b>and </b>the range of locations they’re available in. Do you want to be close to the entertainment capital, or would you prefer something a little more laid back? Do you want a villa close to the sea, or an apartment in our majestic capital city, Valletta? We’ve got a property to suit every taste and budget.
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhmDF8PZDtSNjFAI/giphy.gif" />

<b>2. Clear, accurate photos</b>
Steer clear of any kind of accommodation offerings that do not provide any (or indeed enough) photos of what you are paying for. Ideally, you want to be able to see photos of the bedroom/s, bathroom/s, kitchen, lounge and (if this applies) the pool area too. That way, you know what to expect and can hold the provider accountable if you don’t get what was advertised.

<b>3. Dates, prices, options</b>
Who has time to waste? Not us! When you’re interested in a property, you want to know exactly how much it’ll cost and whether or not it’s available right away. That’s why when you visit <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortletsmalta.com</a> you can punch in your details and get quotes and availability right away! Simple.
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IyiKbiDdEalPyes/giphy.gif" />

<b>4. Get social</b>
Social media is a great way to get to know a company, see what people are saying about it, and check out what’s on offer. On that note, you can keep up to date with our short let properties and all the Maltese fun you could possibly want via our Facebook page! Hit that like button to stay informed.

<b>5. Quality customer service </b>
If anything <i>does </i>go wrong, you want to feel like you can talk to your provider and that they’ll get it sorted ASAP. When you choose <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Short Lets Malta</a>, you can get in touch with us any time - we’ve got you covered.

            [content] => Malta - the small island with a very big personality indeed. One of the things we love most about our three sun-drenched pieces of Mediterranean paradise is this: no matter how many times you’ve visited, or how long you have lived here, there is always something new to discover. From technicolour sunsets that need no filter, to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/trekking"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>scenic treks</u></span></a> through the rugged Maltese countryside, secret, long-forgotten caves to explore and beyond, there’s no end to the things you’ll see here.

            [content] => Sunsets are a gift at the end of each day, and Malta is surely blessed with some great spots where these daily marvels can be viewed. The best sunsets in Malta can be seen from the Western side of the islands, West being the direction in which the sun sets. Watching sunsets is a perfect way to end a spring or summer day, so here are some of our favourite sunset-viewing spots on the Maltese Islands.

<ol>
	<li><strong>Golden Bay</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BgMZQBAg_Qb/?hl=enamp;tagged=goldenbaymalta
The fiery Golden Bay is a spectacle during all times of the day; however this beach takes on new life during sunsets. The warm hues play well with the beach’s orange sand, which offers a comfy prime location from which to view a majestic sunset or two.

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Dingli Cliffs</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgohys6FOJ8/?hl=enamp;taken-at=236387442
The majestic Dingli cliffs offer an uninterrupted view out to sea, perfect for witnessing an end to another day in the most beautiful of ways. Unlike Golden Bay, this location isn’t as comfortable, however there are a few dispersed benches which offer a place to rest while watching the sun dissolve into the Mediterranean. Make sure to take a blanket or a cardi while sunset-watching here, as the Cliffs get quite chilly as soon as the sun sets!

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>It-Torri l-Ahmar</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BedjXcTH_lY/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1001771327
Located on top of a hill in Mellieha, it-Torri l-Ahmar might not seem like the most accessible of spots. Yet it is fairly easy to get to, and the view from up there is truly something. Venture further into the area and find a cosy spot overlooking the sea for some Instagram worthy #sunset shots. This spot is also great for sunrise watching, as the hill provides great views on both sides.

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Blue Lagoon</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhwgpItgEj5/?hl=enamp;tagged=comino
Sunsets at the Blue Lagoon in Comino are even more magical – the crystal clear waters offer an idyllic backdrop to the dramatic setting of the sun. The big bonus of this location is that you can enjoy the natural spectacle while swimming in the clearest water in the Mediterranean; something which you don’t get to do every day!

<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Xlendi Bay</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BfdaIpFnKrA/?hl=enamp;tagged=xlendi
<a name="_GoBack"></a>Xlendi Bay in Gozo seems to have been created for the sole purpose of sunset-watching. The valley’s cliffs frame the sun’s setting perfectly during the summer, with the sun descending into the sea in the middle of the horizon. Grab an ice cream or a couple of cocktails from the many restaurants and bars on the beach front, and prepare to be blown away!

As much as you might enjoy bringing back that “Hey everyone I was on holiday” tan as a souvenir, it is 2018, and by now it is a well known fact that the sun is NOT your friend. From heatstroke to skin cancer, the sun can truly be an enemy. The obvious solution to unbearable heat is to go to the beach, but that’s not always viable (more on that later).
<span style="font-size:small;"> </span>

The question is, how are you going to keep up your “beach bae” status and still treat your body as a temple this summer? Here at ShortLets Malta, we care about your reputation and your health; we’ve therefore compiled a list of ways you can take care of yourself whilst enjoying your holiday of a lifetime. Here are 5 ways to deal with a Maltese Summer this 2018.
<b>1.Drink lots of water: </b>Let’s face it- this is probably the most basic, yet most important tip we can offer. With possible highs of 42ºC this year, your average 8 glasses a day just won’t do! The EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) recommends an average of 2 litres a day for women, and an average of 2.5 litres a day for men. Avoiding sugar, additives and calories in your drinks is also a must, and supplementing your daily pint (or two) of beer by the beach with water will ensure that you stay super hydrated. Carry a bottle of cold water wherever you go, as you never know when you might need it the most!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BhgzPbCl7AY/?tagged=maltabeach
<b>2. Wear Sunscreen: </b>It’s our most effective tool against the sun (except, of course, when it comes to staying out of the sun, but it’s summer so why would you?). It reflects of absorbs those pesky UV rays, whilst protecting your skin against wrinkles, moles and sagging skin. It is recommended that one wears sunscreen of SPF 30 or even higher, to be applied every hour or so, especially if you’re by the pool, at the beach, or actively sweating. Don’t forget to apply sunscreen to your ears, face, neck…even your lips!
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhLrSRrn_Me/?tagged=maltabeach
<b>3. Avoid peak hours: </b>If you’re spending a<b> </b>day by the beach with your family and/or friends, remember this important bit of information: the sun gets particularly hot and unbearable between 12pm-4pm. It is SUPER recommended that those hours are spent under the shade of an umbrella, or indoors. If being outside cannot be avoided, refer to tip number two (2) over, and over, and over, and over again.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhDpqx6BeOT/?tagged=maltabeach
<b>4. Know which beach to hit: </b>It is important to update yourself daily on which beach to visit that day. Wind and sea conditions can make it dangerous to swim that day, which is why the Malta Red Cross and Malta’s 100.2 FM Radio collaborated and came up with the Which Beach website (follow this link: <a href="https://whichbeach.com.mt/"><u><b>https://whichbeach.com.mt</b></u></a>), updated daily to provide you with the best beach to visit on the day, and all the information you might need on that particular beach. Look out for coloured flags found on said beach; blue flags mean that the beach is clean, safe and enjoy the highest quality of bathing water, whilst green flags mark safe to bathe beaches. On the other hand, look out for yellow, red and double red flags: yellow indicates low danger, red indicates high danger, and double red flags indicate extreme danger.
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg8HkF7FXyC/?tagged=maltabeach
<b>5. Know your beach laws: </b>Even though its 2018, and #freethenipple was and still is a thing in modern society, sunbathing topless on a Maltese beach is not legal. Skinny dipping is also quite illegal, and walking around towns and villages in a bikini or shirtless after a day at the beach can also lead to fines (not exactly the memento you were expecting to take back home).

Have a safe and healthy summer!

            [content] => <span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Stumped on what gifts to get for family and friends after a memorable trip to The Maltese Islands? This week we bring you 8 artisanal gifts that are unique as much as they are representative of Malta and Gozo’s arts, crafts and cultural heritage to give and share back home. Read on!</span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Filigree Jewellery </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4419 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh.jpg" alt="gh" width="423" height="486" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">As a form of metalwork, filigree jewellery is created from silver and gold and is renowned for its delicate and intricate appearance. For a wide selection of designs head to St. Lucia or Merchants Street in Valletta where several jewellery shops offer a wide selection of pendants, earrings and bracelets. We recommend searching for designs that feature the Maltese cross.</span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Lace </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4420 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh1.jpg" alt="gh1" width="430" height="363" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Lace-making is Malta’s quintessential traditional craft that extends back to the 16</span></span><sup><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">th</span></span></sup><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"> century. It conjures up images of women sitting outside crafting lace whilst enjoyi</span></span><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">ng the cooler evening air and in some rural areas, this tradition is alive and a vibrant aspect of village life. That said, handmade lace with high craftsmanship tends to be quite expensive and hard to come by. However, several gift shops provide manufactured versions of the more traditional and wrought designs that still make for a unique gift. </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Natural Soap </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4421 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh2.jpg" alt="gh2" width="432" height="493" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">The Maltese Islands are home to a vast array of Mediterranean plants that may be used for their essential oils and cleansing properties. Prickly pear, orange, natural herbs and olive oil all make for wonderful additions to soaps and cleansers with something for every skin type. SoapCafe in Sliema offers a selection of soap and other items made with Maltese ingredients. </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Handmade Glass Items </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4422 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh3.jpg" alt="gh3" width="430" height="392" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Handmade glassware makes for mesmerising patterns and designs that stand to brighten and decorate any room. Mdina Glass is arguably the most renowned for this craft with stores spread across the island and tours open for visitors to observe their craftsmen in Ta’ Qali (Malta). Opt for a small paperweight or a more intricate vase or lamp for an artistic reminder of your trip. </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Gozitan Salt</b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4423 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh4.jpg" alt="gh4" width="433" height="497" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">No trip to Gozo is complete without a visit to the iconic globigerina limestone formations and saltpans in Marsalforn. The 350-year-old saltpans are located on a 3km stretch of coastline and are central to Gozo’s multi-generational sea-salt production. Locals collect the salt during the hot summer months, store and then process it in limestone caves in the area. The packaged salt is then sold to locals and tourists alike. Some sellers set up shop in the area specifically for tourists although be sure to head over in the late summer-autumn months! </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Indigenous Wine Varieties </b></span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Viticulture is a small yet high-quality industry in the Maltese Islands with many local wineries producing international as well as local varieties of wine. Wineries produce two kinds of indigenous grapes and wine: Ġellewża and Għirgħentina. Head over to any of the main local wineries such as Marsovin, Delicata or Meridiana for a taste and a chance to purchase some of these varieties. </span></span>

            [content] => Nothing beats the smell of freshly baked Maltese bread. Locally referred to as ‘Hobz tal-Malti’, Maltese bread tastes like no other bread in the world! We have followed the bread baking process at Falzon Bakery in Rabat who are still following an old recipe and bake their bread inside a traditional wood fired oven.

            [content] => <span style="font-size:medium;">Travelling with kids on a family vacation is a great way to bond and grow as a family. Now that summer is approaching and children worldwide can enjoy a time of relaxation school-free, many families decide to embark on a family adventure, and venture out into an unknown location for a much-needed family holiday. Travelling with kids in tow can be a challenging experience, sometimes proving to be even more stressful than everyday life. Yet some of these stresses can be kept at bay with a few simple tricks, ensuring a peaceful and tranquil holiday for both kids and parents. Planning on exploring a new location with your family this summer? Check out our tried and tested tips for a smooth-sailing family vacation! </span>

<h3 class="western">Rent a Vacation Home</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4489" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/villablu.jpg" alt="VillaBlu" width="797" height="532" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">When deciding where to stay on your family trip, it is always best to choose the ideal accommodation for you and your family members. Opting for a vacation home instead of a hotel room works much better for families, providing you with ample space and with a home environment, which helps children adapt to their new accommodation better. Family rooms in hotels tend to feel cramped and claustrophobic, leaving kids annoyed and cranky. Make sure to choose a vacation home to suit your budget and family needs – if you’re planning on exploring for most of your stay, then an <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/Sunny_2-bedroom_with_Jacuzzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a></span><b> </b><span style="font-size:medium;">would be a great option, whereas if you’re planning on relaxing for most of your holiday, then a vacation <a href="https://www.luxuryvillasmalta.com/villa-blu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">villa</a></span><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>, </b></span><span style="font-size:medium;">complete with pool and various amenities would be the ideal choice. </span>

<h3 class="western">Keep your kids entertained</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4488" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/babytablet.jpg" alt="BabyTablet" width="5184" height="3456" />
This is especially relevant if your kids are still young and get bored easily. Bringing a tablet full of their favourite TV shows and cartoons can be a life-saver when travelling, and make sure to pack your HDMI cable so that you can connect the tablet directly to the TV feed. Downloading some colouring apps or educational games will also keep kids entertained and happy, and you can choose apps depending on your child’s interests. Children, whatever their age, get bored easily, so while the National Museum of Archaeology may seem like a wonderland of artefacts for you, it sounds like the most boring thing ever for your kids. Be prepared and avoid meltdowns with distractions as soon as irritability hits!

<h3 class="western">Bring ‘rewards’ for those dreaded long transits</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4494" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/reward1.jpg" alt="Reward" width="5184" height="3456" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">Travelling is generally awesome, and a great way to expand your kids’ world-view. However it can also be tiring, especially when long travelling times are involved. Even adults get cantankerous on long-haul flights or coach rides, let alone little ones. There is no sure way to avoid tantrums or melt-downs, and the best way to deal with these outbursts is to go with the flow and not worry too much about them before they actually happen. However it never hurts to be equipped for the worst, and this includes bringing ‘rewards’ such as small toys or colouring books to recompense good behaviour. Kids will be entertained by the novelty of the ‘reward’ for their manners, keeping them busy and happy for more precious travelling time. </span>

<h3 class="western">Rent whatever equipment you can</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4496" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/stroller1.jpg" alt="Stroller" width="2560" height="1707" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">When travelling with kids, it is always better to travel as light as you can, thereby avoiding long waits at the luggage retrieval section at the airport, problems with fitting your entire luggage on transport and unnecessary headaches of lost luggage. Whatever equipment you can rent on site, rent it! From strollers, to high chairs and cots, most locations will offer rental options which will save you time and packing space. Vacation rental properties offer high chairs and baby cots on demand as well, meaning less worrying for vacationing parents! </span>

<h3 class="western">Take it easy – don’t pack too many activities in one day</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4495" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/takeiteasyfamily1.jpg" alt="TakeItEasyFamily" width="6720" height="4480" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">Travelling alone and travelling as a family have their similarities – yet day planning is not one of them. While it may be tempting to pack as many activities as you can into one day, and while this plan may work when travelling alone, it will generally result in very grumpy and very tired kiddos. While planning day to day vacation activities even when travelling with kids is a smart way to travel, make sure to not over-plan your days, as anything and everything may happen when vacationing with kids in tow. Keep your days light, plan one or two activities per day, and take it from there. If your kids are feeling up to it and still have high energy levels then wing it and decide on a new activity there and then. You’ll be thankful for not over-stuffing your days after a tired kid’s meltdown at the end of a tour. </span>

<h3 class="western">Packing list – write everything down</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4498" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/packinglist.jpg" alt="PackingList" width="1920" height="993" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">By now most travellers swear by the packing list – you can start compiling this list as early as you wish, adding essential things to pack as you remember them. The list becomes even more vital when travelling as a family, where each family member has their own indispensable items to bring on holiday. You can involve older kids in the packing fun by giving them their own list to compile, thereby ensuring that they bring their favourite items along too. Younger kids can be given a pictographic list of important items to pack, transforming packing their bag into a little game. Also, give each child their own personal bag – younger children will feel more responsible and grown-up carrying their very own luggage!</span>

<h3 class="western">Buy disposable items when you arrive</h3>
<span style="font-size:medium;">While we do encourage that you pack </span><span style="font-size:medium;"><i>some </i></span><span style="font-size:medium;">disposable items (such as nappies and wet wipes) for your trip, don’t stuff your bags with them. Chances are you’ll be able to buy these items from the local supermarket wherever you’re visiting, often finding the same brands you find at home. Pack a few nappies and wet wipes to last your journey, then head to the local supermarket or pharmacy and buy these items on arrival. You’ll save up so much luggage space using this method - meaning you’ll have more room for items which are truly indispensable for your trip. </span>

            [content] => Located on Malta’s west coast, Dingli Cliffs are the highest point on the island standing at 253m above sea level. The cliffs are perfect for peaceful walks while admiring the stunning panoramic views and an endless horizon. It’s hard to describe the beauty of this location at sunset and visiting at this time is highly recommended.

One cannot picture Malta without picturing churches and chapels, monumental proof of the island’s deep Catholic roots. It is said that there are 365 churches and chapels around the islands, one for every day of the year. Most of these religious temples are sky-high, adorned with imposing columns and great domes and steeples. Yet Malta is also dotted with quaint limestone chapels, not much bigger than a room, some of which date back to medieval times. Today we take a tour of 8 of these charming chapels around Malta, beautiful testimonies of the island’s faith since early times.
<strong>Chapel of St Mary Magdalene – Dingli</strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BftEtk4AIck/?hl=enamp;taken-at=236387442
The chapel perched precariously on the vertiginous cliffs of Dingli is perhaps one of the best known chapels on the island. Visitors strolling the cliffs are sure to encounter this modest chapel, while some even start their cliff exploration using her as a starting point. The chapel is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, however it is also known as the Chapel of the Cliffs. The earliest records show that the chapel has been standing treacherously in its place since 1446, and it used to be the go-to church for the farmers of the area.

<strong>Chapel of Our Lady of Atocia, known as tas-Samra – Hamrun</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BJDktlHB6Si/?hl=enamp;tagged=tassamra
The Chapel of Our Lady of Atocia in Hamrun is one of the lesser known churches on this list. Tucked away in a small alleyway in the central town of Hamrun, the chapel known as ‘Tas-Samra’ to the Maltese (the name, meaning ‘of the tanned Lady’, derives from the icon found in the church depicting a dark-skinned Madonna) was built as the chapel we know today in 1630. This chapel is peculiar as it is fairly larger than most chapels’ layouts, and it has a beautiful arched façade, built in the Spanish style.

<strong>Church of Our Lady of the Snows – Marsaxlokk</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BTn5D5ijWH8/?hl=enamp;taken-at=238721887
Suspended above the picturesque town of Marsaxlokk is the grand-looking chapel of Our Lady of the Snows, known among the locals as ‘Tas-Silg’. This chapel’s location has been used as a place of worship since ancient times, and we learn from Cicero that a temple dedicated to Juno stood on this spot during Roman rule. However this location had been used as a temple even by the Phoenicians, who erected a temple dedicated to Astarte here, while the Carthaginians transformed this temple into a place of worship to their god Melkart. The site near the chapel is also an archaeological site, still closed to the public as excavations are ongoing. The chapel dates back to 1650; however the structure was rebuilt again in 1832.

<strong>Immaculate Conception Chapel  - Ahrax, Mellieha</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZBc0AnjEPN/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1133102863387974
Ahrax Point in Mellieha is one of the northernmost points on the island, right on the edge of Malta’s ‘tail’. When one reaches this point two features stand out: the niche standing at the very edge of the cliffs, and the peaceful little chapel, humble and inconspicuous. This chapel is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, and unlike most of the other churches in this list, is not all that old. The earliest records depicting this chapel date it back to the beginning of the 20th Century, a relative new-born when compared to the other chapels around the island. The original chapel stood even closer to the edge of the cliffs, yet the placement was changed due to erosion of the cliffs below.

<strong>The Chapel of Our Lady of Itria – Bingemma</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/5zEUMLPzHF/?taken-at=74290334
Another chapel dangling perilously on the edge of a valley is the chapel of Our Lady of Itria, in the scenic hamlet of Bingemma. ‘Itria’ derives from the Orthodox nomenclature Hodegetria, meaning ‘she who knows the way’. This chapel was built in 1600, when many devotees revered the Madonna of Itria. What is amazing about this chapel it its location. To the right of the chapel, an uneven pathway leads down to a quaint valley, the sides of which are pockmarked by a series of tombs, or rock hewn caves. Mystery still shrouds this area, as archaeologists still do not agree on whether these caverns were used as tombs, or whether they were ancient dwellings.

<strong>Chapel of St Paul the Hermit – Wied il-Ghasel, Mosta</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BhgnI8vg1fv/?taken-at=1033519944
Wied il-Ghasel in Mosta has been forever immortalised in a popular Maltese song, highlighting the beauty of the area. The chapel of St Paul the Hermit adds further charm and exquisiteness to the already fascinating area; the chapel is built in a natural cave opening, incorporating the cave walls into its own structure. The legend surrounding this chapel goes that a saintly hermit lived in the cave before the chapel was built. Some Maltese had started living immorally, and had received fair warnings from the hermit who advised them to change their life’s course. Relentless, and seeing that the hermit lived such a pious life, they decided to tempt him into a life of sin, sending a woman down to his cave in order to seduce him. The hermit could not take their taunting any longer and therefore decided to head first to Comino, then to Gozo. Instead of taking a boat as one would normally do when crossing over to the islands, the hermit lay down his cloak on the water, and travelled on it as if it were a raft. Upon seeing this miraculous event, the Maltese people realised that he was a saint, and asked for his forgiveness. They built a small chapel where the hermit used to dwell, and dedicated it to St Paul the Hermit.

<strong>Chapel of St Matthew – Maqluba, Qrendi</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BgJm3khhcK1/?taken-at=1016179016
It seems that the Maltese had a knack for building chapels hazardously close to the edge. Yet the chapel of St Matthew in Qrendi is an exception. This chapel dates as far back as the 11th century, before the Maqluba sinkhole was formed. It is said that the chapel avoided destruction by the sinkhole miraculously, after the village that stood where the sinkhole is now located was destroyed and engulfed by the earth in a violent storm in 1343. The chapel that stands there today is composed of two adjoining chapels – known as ‘iz-Zghir’ (the small) and ‘il-Kbir’ (the large). The larger chapel was built in 1682.

<strong>Immaculate Conception Chapel – Spinola Bay, St Julian’s</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BiStJNtAk8X/?tagged=spinolabay
Camouflaged among the modern buildings and restaurants along Spinola Bay, one finds a small chapel dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. At first glance, the chapel is almost unnoticeable, as it blends into the hodgepodge of buildings along the seafront. Back when St Julian’s was an idle fishermen’s village, this unassuming chapel served as a place of worship for the workers of the area, and it was known by the name ‘tas-Sajjieda’ meaning ‘of the fishermen’. Nowadays the chapel has been squashed on both sides by imposing modern buildings, yet she holds on steadfastly and looks out to the bay whose fishermen she once served. The site was first used in 1580, when a church known as ‘ta’ Lapsi’ was built after the Great Siege. The church as we know it today was built in 1688 by Fra Paolo Rafel Spinola, whose name is still connected to the area to this day.

Here’s all you need to know about the artists who will be joining Like Mike and Dimitri Vegas in this year’s open air festival.
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3HuJwtaLm1RBLEJOp1/giphy.gif" />

<strong>Jason Derulo</strong>
This is Derulo’s second trip to Malta; he’s already performed at the music festival in 2015, so we’re expecting him to be on fire this year! Derulo rose to fame back in 2009, with popular hits such as “In my Head”, “Whatcha Say” and “Don’t Wanna Go Home”. More recently the American artist released the hit singles “Want to Want Me” and “Swalla”. We’re suspecting that Derulo will preview some exclusive performances from his upcoming 2018 album, entitled “777”. We’ll just have to wait and see what he has in store for us!

<strong>Hailee Steinfeld</strong>
This gorgeous American actress/singer is only 21 years old, yet she’s already dominated the big screen with an Oscar nomination for her role in “True Grit”, her role in “Pitch Perfect 2” and “Pitch Perfect 3” (featuring other stars such as Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson”, and has also conquered the charts with her new 2017 singles “Most Girls” and “Let Me Go”. Steinfeld is also wrapping up her debut studio album as we speak, so let’s collectively pray for some exclusive album sneak-peaks!

<strong>Sigala</strong>
Also known as Bruce Fielder, this English DJ, record producer and remixer from Norfolk has already taken over the UK Singles Chart with his 2015 singles “Easy Love”, featuring vocals from the famous Jackson 5’s “ABC”, and “Sweet Lovin’”. Another single, “Lullaby”, this time featuring the vocals of Paloma Faith, was released in February 2018, and will surely be performed during the music festival. Just like his peers, Sigala has also recorded a studio album, to be released as early as 20th July 2018. Stay tuned!

<strong>Paloma Faith</strong>
As previously mentioned, Paloma Faith will be lending her live vocals to Sigala’s performance this year. Yet don’t be fooled, the English actress, singer and songwriter is a force to be reckoned with. Her retro-inspired album “Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?” came out back in 2009, reaching double platinum status and a BRIT award nomination. Her second album, “Fall to Grace”, reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart. She’s also appeared in films such as “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus”, “St. Trinian’s” and the widely acclaimed television talent show “The Voice UK”. Expect only greatness from this artist!

<strong>Ella Eyre</strong>
Another great artist performing alongside Sigala, Eyre will be displaying her gorgeous vocal abilities performing the hit single “Came here for Love”. Eyre first rose to prominence via her hit single with Rudimental, entitled “Waiting all Night”. Her next three solo singles, “If I Go”, “Together” and “Comeback” reached the top 20 in the UK Singles Charts, and she hasn’t stopped there. On 5th March, 2018, Eyre announced her new single, “Answerphone”, which peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. Get ready for a performance of a lifetime!

NB: This festival is a free one; all are welcome to enjoy the concert! However, due to overcrowding, tickets will need to be acquired to attend the show. Fans will have the option to pre-register for the event, which will be open for two weeks prior to the official ticketing launch- each individual is allowed a maximum of four tickets. On the day of the event, both printed and digital tickets will be accepted at the various entrances to the concert. Sounds fair, no? Save the date, and get booking!

            [content] => <span lang="mt-MT">We have already covered our islands’ best sunset-viewing spots, so it was only natural that we would also show you the best locations for witnessing grandiose sunrises. Dawn may not be as favoured a time of day, simply because many people would rather sleep for a couple of more minutes than wake up early. For those of you who aren’t discouraged by an impending alarm, or who are coming back from a night out in the wee hours of the morning, or out jogging or exercising before the day begins: this list’s for you! Here are our top sunrise spotting sites on the Maltese Islands.</span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Grand Harbour, Valletta</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUqcfv8huS3/?hl=enamp;tagged=vallettasunrise
<span lang="mt-MT">The Grand Harbour is a prime sunrise viewing spot, giving you an unobstructed view of the horizon. Head to the capital before it becomes hoarded with people, grab a coffee from the kiosks near the bus terminus, and walk straight down Republic Street to get to the tip of the Valletta peninsula , then head down to the coast for a truly unforgettable sunrise experience. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Surfside Rocky Beach, Sliema</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNNEyiKFFj3/?hl=enamp;tagged=sliemasunrise
<span lang="mt-MT">The whole coastline of Sliema offers some truly spectacular sunrise spots, yet sitting on the rocks at Surfside, hearing the soft lapping of the waves against the shore, is an experience in itself. Whether you stop and take in the view while on your morning jog, or you take a break on your way home from St Julian’s after a good night out, this sunrise sight is sure to leave you speechless. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">St Thomas Bay, Marsascala</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BViGVqCli6K/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1027339170
<span lang="mt-MT">If you find yourself in the southern part of Malta in the early hours of the morning, make sure to head over to St Thomas Bay in Marsascala to witness a beautiful dawn over the turuoise sea of the bay. This spot is also ideal for a bit of early swimming, especially during the summer months when the sun starts sizzling as soon as it rises. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Birgu Shoreline</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh4i-FzAzDY/?hl=enamp;taken-at=181295
<span lang="mt-MT">The shoreline on the Kalkara side of Birgu is a great location to sit by the sea in a peaceful environment. Paired with a fiery sunrise, this spot becomes even more magical. Nestled between Fort St Angelo and the Bighi Hospital in Kalkara, this sunrise spot offers a different point of view of the Grand Harbour, ideal for some sweet Instagram snaps!</span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Ta’ Xbiex Coastline</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhH2D9klLbj/?hl=enamp;taken-at=257223367
<span lang="mt-MT">This coastline stretching from Msida to Gzira is a top spot for watc</span>hing a beautiful sunrise framed by Valletta’s iconic coast on one side, and Manoel Island on the other. The sun rises between these two expanses of land and creates a breath-taking silhouette effect. The area is also dotted with quaint cafes, meaning you can recharge with some java before starting your day.
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Cittadella, Gozo</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BfSVWAYjuer/?hl=enamp;tagged=gozosunrise

<span lang="mt-MT">If you’re staying in Gozo while on your trip, watching the sunrise from the ancient wall city of Cittadella, just above the Gozitan capital Victoria. The city was built on top of one of the highest hills in Gozo, giving you a broad view over the whole island. Head over to the bastions on the eastern side of the city to witness a wonderful sunrise above Malta and Comino, then grab a couple of </span><span lang="mt-MT"><i>pastizzi</i></span><span lang="mt-MT"> and a typical </span><span lang="mt-MT"><i>te fit-tazza</i></span><span lang="mt-MT"> (tea in a glass) for a truly memorable experience. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Qbajjar Salt Pans, Gozo</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/4PrKGGLFUZ/?hl=enamp;tagged=gozosunrise
<span lang="mt-MT">If you’re in the Marsalforn area at around 6am, you must go to the Qbajjar salt pans to view the sunrise. The salt pans reflect the sky in the most enchanting way, making dawn even more dazzling and dramatic. Afterwards, a quick dip in the pebbly beach of Qbajjar will surely refresh you and prepare you for the day ahead!</span>

            [content] => If you want to visit a typical Maltese village, look no further than gorgeous “L-Imgarr”- a village known for its history, culture, and more importantly, its food. Mgarr is found within the Northern Regions of Malta, particularly closest to Mosta and adjacent to Mellieha. Known for its fertile farmland and vineyards, Mgarr is a predominantly agricultural area, home to many of the island’s farmers. Its peaceful surroundings warrant a day’s visit- here is Shortlet Malta’s guide to the lovely village of Mgarr!
<strong>1.Ta’ Hagrat Temples:</strong> Mgarr has two important prehistoric sites both of which are still in great condition and UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Ta’ Hagrat is a megalithic temple found just outside of Mgarr’s town centre, which happens to be divided in two- one larger megalithic temple belonging to the Ggantija phase (3600-3200 BCE) and a smaller temple dating back to the Saflieni phase (3300-3000 BCE). The site was excavated by Malta’s very own Sir Temi Zammit between 1923 and 1926, and plenty of antique pottery was found on site.

<strong>2. Skorba Temples:</strong> Mgarr’s second prehistoric site and megalithic temple is found a mere kilometer outside the Ta’ Hagrat Temple area. The Skorba Temples are not as well preserved as Ta’ Hagrat Temples are, however what is fascinating about this temple is not what the eye beholds, but rather the discoveries made due to it. The Skorba area seems to have been inhabited way back in the very early in the Neolithic period, and the deposits found at its base contained matrial which dated back to the first known human occupation of Malta, circa 4850 BC!

<strong>3. Neighbouring Beaches:</strong> When visiting Mgarr, you are never too far from the beach: Gnejna Bay, Golden Bay and Ghajn Tuffieha are only a 10 minute drive from the village centre. All three beaches are predominantly sandy beaches, with convenient rocky areas. Golden Bay and Ghajn Tuffieha sit adjacent to each other; whilst Ghajn Tuffieha promotes quiet, nature-loving surroundings, Golden Bay boasts a “party-like” environment, with volleyball tournaments being held, bars, restaurants, barbecues and even beach parties. Gnejna Bay, on the other hand, is a small, golden sanded beach, great for family trips. Take your pick- they are all beautiful in their own unique ways!

<strong>4. Nature Trails and Hiking Opportunities:</strong> Feeling active and adventurous? Mgarr is a mecca for hikers and nature-lovers alike. For the more adventurous souls, Fomm ir-Rih is the ideal place for trekking, snorkelling and diving. Boasting incredulous views and a secluded beach, it is perfect for those who enjoy a struggle to then relax all day long. For those of us who prefer more relaxing walks, Mgarr is only a short drive away from scenic areas such as Victoria Lines and Bingemma- unobstructed countryside views await you!

<strong>5. Enjoy a “Fenkata”:</strong> For those lucky few who can get over the fact that rabbit are super duper cute and the guilt of eating them, a fenkata is just the thing you need to feel like a proper Malteser. Head over to il-Barri, a restaurant right next to the Mgarr Parish Church (hard to miss!) and enjoy a bountiful meal of anything that is typically Maltese: dips and “galletti” (crackers) as an appetizer, a bowl of spaghetti with rabbit sauce as a starter, and a nice chunk of rabbit for your main. There is truly nothing like having to move the belt buckle a hole or two down after filling your belly with gorgeous Maltese food!

This church miraculously survived the second world war when a high explosive bomb pierced the dome on the 9th April 1942 while 300 people were attending mass. The bomb did not explode and none of the people inside were harmed. This is a truly beautiful church with a rich history and definitely worth seeing while in Malta!

Summer is with us and a day trip to Comino is a must. Explore this beautiful island’s natural beauty and swim in the crystal clear waters of the blue lagoon.

[wpvideo 59cCR3Z2]

<strong> Comino and the Blue Lagoon</strong>
The tiny Island of Comino is situated right in the middle of the channel that separates mainland Malta from the island of Gozo. It is the smallest inhabited island of the Maltese Archipelago and the most pristine one, attracting all those who love swimming, snorkelling, diving, and other water sports. Between Comino and its adjacent island Cominotto lies the so-called Blue Lagoon.
This scenic bay with its crystal clear blue sea provides one of the most spectacular sights of the Maltese islands. Comino has an area of 1.5km2 and there are only about eight residents living on the Island. Traffic is non-existent and noise is the exception rather than the rule. The island does however boast a modern hotel, which caters for those who want to escape from it all.
<strong>History of Comino</strong>
There is a small church on Comino that is dedicated to the Return of Our Lady from Egypt. This was first built in 1618 but has been restored many times since then. A 12th century navigational map at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich shows a church where the present one stands. Comino is known to have been inhabited by farmers during Roman times; however for long periods in its history it has been sparsely populated, or abandoned entirely. In the middle ages, Comino was popular with pirates and marauders attracted by its rugged coastline delineated by sheer limestone cliffs and dotted with deep caves. Comino's caves and coves also frequently served as trading posts for raids on boats crossing between Malta and Gozo.
<strong>Knights of Malta in Comino</strong>
The Knights of Malta used Comino for hunting and as recreational grounds. The Knights were fiercely protective of the local game, which consisted of wild boar and hare. Upon conviction, poachers were liable to a penalty of three years as a galley slave. In 1416 the Maltese people petitioned their king, Alphonse V of Aragon, to build a tower on Comino Island to serve as an early warning system in case of invasion and to deter marauding Turks, pirates, smugglers and corsairs from using Comino as a hiding place and staging ground for devastating sorties onto the sister islands of Malta and Gozo. Two years later a special tax was levied on imported wine to raise funds for this project. However, the monies were diverted to the King's coffers, and the Island remained undefended for another two hundred years.
<strong>St. Mary's tower in Comino</strong>
In 1618, The Knights of Malta erected St. Mary's Tower (It-Torri ta' Santa Marija) on the orders of Grandmaster Wignacourt, designed by Maltese architect Vittorio Cassar. Funds for its construction were raised primarily by means of the sale of Comino brushwood. Located roughly in the centre of the southern coast of the Island, it formed part of a chain of defensive towers built by Wignacourt, Lascaris, and De Redin installed at vantage points along the coastline of the Maltese Islands, and greatly improved communications between the Islands of Malta and Gozo. The Tower is a large, square building with four corner turrets, located about 80 metres above sea level. The Tower itself is about 12 metres tall, with walls that are approximately 6 metres thick, and is raised on a platform and plinth that are approximately 8 metres high.
<strong>The history of Comino’s tower</strong>
Comino served as a place of imprisonment or exile in the 16th and 17th centuries for errant knights. Knights who were convicted of minor crimes were occasionally sentenced to the lonely and dangerous task of manning St. Mary's Tower. During times of crisis its garrison numbered up to 60 soldiers.By 1791 its armament included two 12-pound iron cannons, a 10-pound bronze cannon, a 4-pound bronze cannon, and two 3-pound bronze cannons. During the French Blockade (1798-1800), St. Mary's Tower served as a concentration camp for suspected spies.
In 1829 the British Military abandoned the tower and for several decades it was deemed to be property of the local civil authorities, and may have been used as an isolation hospital, or even as a wintering pen for farm animals. The Tower saw active service once again during both World Wars. In 1982 the Tower became the property of the Armed Forces of Malta and now serves as a lookout and staging post to guard against contraband and the illegal hunting of migratory birds at sea. St. Mary's Tower underwent extensive restoration between 2002 and 2004. Today, it remains the most notable structure on Comino, and provides a destination for tourists taking walks around the Island.

The long, sun-drenched days melt away into fiery sunsets and cool yet lively nights, and time spent relaxing isn’t just accepted, but actively encouraged by the locals. So what’s the best way to cool down when you’re visiting our gem of an island this summer?

<span lang="en-US">When you’re surrounded by gentle blue waves as far as the eye can see, it’s basically </span><span lang="en-US"><i>impossible </i></span><span lang="en-US"> to resist going for a dip. Snorkeling or scuba diving are two great ways to keep cool while you get up close and personal with the real ‘locals’ underwater. Grab your goggles and a set of flippers and get ready to be immersed in a cyan-coloured world so magical, you’l forget you live on land.</span>

<span lang="en-US">Revitalise your mind and body with a spot of yoga - but wit ha twist! SUP Yoga is ‘stand up paddle’ yoga, done on a surf board in calm waters. Even if your balance is on point, you might still find yourself ‘falling’ into that tempting blue sea to cool down after all that hard work.</span>

            [content] => Planning your visit to the island of Gozo? Thinking what are the best beaches for a cool summer dip in the Mediterranean waters? You have probably heard of the famous Ramla Bay that is known for its redish-orange sand and is a visitors’ must during your stay in Gozo. Surrounded by cliffs on both sides, boasting clear waters and spacious accommodations, Ramla seems like the obvious choice. Moreover, it is easily accessible by car or public transport.
Yet in case you are feeling a bit more adventurous and would like to explore paths less travelled leading to more secluded, absolutely stunning beaches of Gozo, here is our guide to top five.
<b>Hondoq Ir Rummien</b>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4694" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/i1.jpg" alt="i1" width="1024" height="768" />Hondoq Bay is a small sandy beach that is easily reachable by car from Mgarr ferry station through the village of il-Qala. Nature lovers and avid hikers, not discouraged by heights, have the opportunity to take a charming coastal walk to Hondoq. Leave the Ferry Station torwards the Mgarr Marina. Walk past the Marina towards Zewwieqa Bay, which is a perfect spot for a quick cool-off swim before embarking on a ragged coastal path, which you will find at the end of the Zewwieqa Bay. The path is relatively safe although precautions should be taken and appropriate footwear is a must. Also drinking plenty of water is recommended to prevent sudden dehydration. The views including a distant glimpse of the famous Blue Lagoon of the Island of Comino, will be worth every drop of sweat you will expend on this walk.
Right before Hondoq Bay, you might be pleasantly surprised to discover a small inlet called Bemberejn. Surrounded by rock formation and sheltering turquoise waters it will be beckoning you to refresh yourself after a strenuous hike.


[gallery ids="4698,4697" type="rectangular"]
You will already be able to spot Hondq Bay from Bemberejn.
Hondoq Bay itself is a cozy, low-key hangout mostly for locals. You can rent a sunbed/umbrella combo and enjoy a variety of cold refreshments and delicious snacks from the Lunch Box stand just up the road. Another option is the little restaurant shack right across from the beach. You are welcome to taste their catch of the day, (also available in a fish amp; chips combo is you feel like indulging yourself) and enjoy a cold local beer variety called Cisk or another drink of your choice.
<b>Dahlet Qorrot</b>

Dahlet Qorrot is an old fishing bay. Its main attractions are multi-colored doors of charming boat houses build inside of the limestone formations surrounding the beach and of course, its iridescent, crystal clear waters to swim in. Moreover, with its abundant and colorful sea-life, the area of Dahlet Qorrot has become a beloved spot for diving and snorkeling.
The beach can be accessed by car from the Mgarr ferry station via the village of in-Nadur. Access by pubic transport is a bit tricky unless you are not afraid of a bit of a walk. If you choose to walk, however, you will be rewarded with beautiful sights of local farmland, lush green nature and gorgeous sea views.
If traveling by bus, take the number 303 either from Mgarr or Rabat Victoria (the central bus station of Gozo’s capital) and get off at the station Qorrot. Then follow the signs that will lead you out to a wide road gradually going downhill. Keep on walking down till you see the beach in the distance. When in doubt, however, ask the locals who are usually very kind and helpful towards lost tourists.
Dahlet Qurrot is a beloved hangout for locals and families as it is quite far away from the usual tourist destinations. In the summer months a small food truck with exceptionally kind and attentive staff will offer you a variety of hot and cold snacks as well as refreshing beverages and ice cream. Dahlet Qorrot is well worth visiting not only to enjoy a nice cool dip but also to get a feel for the local lifestyle of Gozitans.
<b>San Blas</b>


[gallery ids="4706,4701" type="rectangular"]
Located on the coastal side of the village in-Nadur, San Blas Bay is a tiny rustic beach with redish-orange sand, the same shade as Ramla Bay. Although the beach is quite secluded, it can be accessed by car via narrow road from in-Nadur. There are signs throughout the village to help you navigate. Be advised, however, that the last, rather steep portion of the road leading directly to the beach, is closed to traffic. Since the hike down (and up!) the steep road is not for the faint-hearted, the beach is relatively peaceful. On weekends, though there might be quite a few locals hanging out, parking their boats and coming to swim and relax on the beach. San Blas can also be accessed by bus 303 from the Mgarr ferry station or the main bus terminal in Rabat (Victoria). The bust stop to exit is Weraq (NOT Blas), which brings you directly to the top of the steep road offering breath-taking views of the bay.
The beach itself is low key with a cozy restaurant in a shaded area overlooking the bay. Take a seat at one of the wooden tables, and enjoy the beautiful sights while sipping wine and/or choosing between a variety of snacks and an abundance of seafood including fresh local fish.
<b>Mgarr ix-Xini </b>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4693" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/i11.jpg" alt="i11" width="1024" height="744" />
Mgarr ix-Xini is a narrow, secluded inlet close to the Gozitan villages of Ghajnsielem, Xewkija and Sannat. Ix-Xini can be accessed by car or on foot though I must warn you, it is not the easiest of walks: When leaving Mgarr ferry station, follow the south-eastern coastline passing Fort Chambray on your right, leading to a small local beach called Xatt Lahmar and several diving stations. Keep on the path around the coastline until you see the ix-Xini tower. Looking down from the cliffs, the astounding view of crystal blue waters will take your breath away. Aside from offering a purely aesthetic experience, ix-Xini is also a perfect spot for light swimming and relaxing on a sun bed. Those who would like more action, however, are welcome to try out diving and snorkeling. Although the beach waters are quite shallow and thus perfect for families with smaller children, a gradual slope will lead you into deeper seas. The rocks (some even have steps) on each side of the inlet provide a perfect platform for cliff jumping and diving into the crystal clear waters. Several caves in the cliff faces have become beloved exploration spots for divers and adventurers.
The back of the beach hosts a lovely restaurant with a natural tree cover for shade. The restaurant is famous for its amazing local fish dishes, selection of wines and local and foreign beers.
For history buffs, ix- Xini holds stories recounting events that took place during the Turkish invasion of the islands. You can still see steps that were used by the Turks to take the Gozitan captives to their ships. It is also noteworthy to mention that Mgarr ix-Xini was the location where the movie “By The Sea” was shot starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
<b>Ix- Xatt l-Ahmar</b>


[gallery ids="4704,4705" type="rectangular"]
Despite its very close location to the Mgarr ferry station, Xatt l-Ahmar is one of the quietest beaches in Gozo, located in the Gozitan village of Ghajnsielem. You can walk to the beach from Mgarr ferry station via Ghajnsielem following the road downward from Fort Chambray. On hot summer days though, trekking down the long windy road might be cumbersome, so a car would be a more convenient option.
The beach itself is an ideal location for divers particularly due to its main attraction: the shipwreck “Xlendi” which can be found at the depths of this location. For those who just want to relax and swim, the rocky surface with saltpans offers many nooks and crannies for cozily setting up your umbrellas, chairs and towels. This location does not have a restaurant or a food kiosk so taking your own drinks and food provision is a must. The gorgeous surroundings including the far off view of the Fort Chambray, makes this less known gem of a beach an ideal spot for romantic picnics or cozy family time.

            [content] => Aside from its natural “wonders” Malta is well-known for its hospitality and a myriad of culinary delights ranging from traditional Maltese dishes (a blend of Sicilian, Arabic, English, French and Spanish cuisine) countless home-made Italian pasta varieties, an abundance of fresh and delicious seafood choices to endless fresh salad concoctions that will satisfy the most finicky of salad snobs. Also, let us not forget the generous assortment of sweets and pastry variations including mouth-watering Maltese bakes, French and Sicilian delicacies, and an array of raw, gluten-free, sugar-free and dairy-free desserts for the health conscious and/or those following specific diets.
When on holiday, it can be tricky to find a balance between wanting to spurge by trying everything under the sun and choosing between more wholesome options.
To make your journey through the endless maze of restaurants and cafe choices easier and more enjoyable, we have put together a guide of Malta’s cafes and restaurants that have been hits with locals, international foodies and the most demanding of gastronomes.
<strong>U Bistrot or as they call it themselves “Naturally Delicious Grub”</strong>
[gallery ids="4756,4755,4753" type="rectangular"]

​

Situated on the beautiful Balluta Bay, U Bistrot is one of the top tourist choices at any given time of the day as the restaurant is open from 10:00 am till 11:00 pm. In fact, if you happen to read their reviews, many deem the restaurant to be one of the best places to eat in Malta. Looking for a hearty morning grub? Their breakfast menu is rather impressive including a wide range of omelets, eggs benedict, English breakfast, an array of yummy pancake deals and Belgian waffles with maple, chocolate or caramel sauce. Freshly squeezed orange juice, healthy green or red juices, as well as flavorsome smoothies (no sugar added), are options if you want to up on your vitamin intake at breakfast. It’s important to mention that U Bistrot’s kitchen is vegetarian-friendly and also offer vegan and gluten-free options.

Crisp and delicious salad variations with a Mediterranean twist: such as cashew chicken, salmon ricotta, avocado walnut, warm root vegetables and mozzarella etc., served with a delicious home-made dressing and a mix of fresh local vegetables, are the top choices of fitness lovers and clean diet supporters.

Not into salads? Other scrumptious lunch options include elaborate homemade pasta dishes, risotto and gnocchi (gluten-free options included at a slight surcharge) or a variety of meat or veggie burgers, also available on gluten-free bread.

Still hungry? Check out their selection of mouth-watering desserts with (many customers will attest) possibly the best chocolate fondant on the whole island. Crème Brulee, vanilla mousse, a seasonal Pavlova with local strawberries and cream as well as multiple daily and weekly sweet treat additions are your other decadent options.

After a day of soaking up the Mediterranean sun, U Bistrot with its beautiful evening view overlooking Balluta Bay offering refreshing breeze is your perfect spot for a bountiful dinner. Catch of the day fried, grilled or baked with a side of fresh salad, grilled vegetables and/or potato varieties is one to definitely try if you fancy fish. Feeling like splurging a bit? Try the U Bistrot signature dish: sautéed king prawns with a side of crispy salad and toasted Maltese bread arguably one of the tastiest and healthiest wheat bread in Europe.

Not hungry but just wanna chill with a glass of wine or a cocktail? U Bistrot has a wide selection of high quality local and foreign wines as well as their trademark cocktails.
In case you have allergies, particular nutritional needs or other questions, the friendly and attentive U Bistrot staff will make sure you’ll have had a wonderful experience upon leaving the restaurant.
<strong>Mint: Café Sliema Malta</strong>

It is totally worth waking up early to watch the sunrise over the Ghadir Beach, take a dip in its golden waters and then head over to Mint for a chilled breakfast. Our personal recommendation is their sugar-, gluten- and dairy-free avocado cheesecake (freshly made in the morning) with a latte or a strong Americano. Not a fan of sugar-free, gluten-free and dairy-free treats? Not to worry! There are plenty of other yummy breakfast options available: freshly baked croissants, flapjacks, egg and bacon sandwiches and many more.

Trying to start your morning right? Enjoy one of their colorful seasonal juice/smoothie combos. Chilled watermelon juice is a definite hit during the summer months. Wanna spice things up? Add fresh ginger to your juices and smoothies.

Lunch is another culinary celebration at Mint. Elaborate salad combos consisting of a variety of fresh and grilled vegetables, grains, legumes and other additions (cheese, fish, grilled chicken or gourmet cold cuts) are designed to appease vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. Looking for something heartier? Exotic and scrumptious snacks changing weekly and daily such as Thai fishcakes, Aubergine melt, baked sweet potato, classic French Croque Monsieur just to name a few await to surprise and entice you. Usually quite a few vegetarian and vegan options are available daily as well. In case of food allergies it is advisable to consult the staff regarding your options.

Wait, wait, wait! We have not covered the desserts yet! All utterly delicious and making it impossible to choose! All made from scratch and with the best, wholesome ingredients in Mint’s kitchen. Gotta try the Mint’s signature New Zealand carrot cake or maybe their Lemon Meringue Pie? How about their Malibu Cream Cake? Maybe Strawberry amp;White Chocolate Cheesecake? The choices are endless and delectably tantalizing. Wondering if they have something less decadent? Try their Banana amp; Walnut loaf or their dairy-free Apple amp; Raspberry Loaf. Looking for gluten-free treats? Take advantage of Mint’s elaborate selection: Pavlova (seasonal), chocolate orange cake, chocolate hazelnut cake or lemon drizzle.

<strong>Pure Living, Sliema </strong>
[gallery ids="4751,4752,4761" type="rectangular"]

Pure Living was created by two passionate healthy food advocates Trevor Diacono and Debbie Kooy. Both enthusiasts have embraced the challenge to continuously create healthy, delicious and affordable meals and snacks by using naturally grown local produce (free of chemicals, pesticides and preservatives and refined sugar.), hence PURE products. The concept extends further than just healthy food as Pure Living is a comfy, cozy lounge restaurant in the heart of Sliema where you can sit on bean bags, sample organic products, enjoy ginger shots on the house and chat with Trevor (the owner) about exotic recipes and what healthy living entails. At the back of the restaurant, there is a small studio for yoga, meditation and Pilates classes (if interested in taking part, check out their class schedule online under Pure Classes www.pure.com.mt).

The breakfast and lunch choices for vegans, vegetarians, clean eaters, fitness enthusiasts and others who enjoy eating healthy, are endless. Let’s start with the salad bar where you pick your own ingredients: any type of vegetable imaginable under the sun and then add- ons such as chicken, salmon, eggs, feta, goat cheese or multiple vegetarian and vegan options such as falafels, beetroot or nut cakes and others. Overwhelmed by having to build your own? You can pick and choose from their absolute winners: Green Lean Salad, Paleo Salad, Super Salad or Tuna Turner. Other absolute hits include Salmon Poached Egg amp; Guacamole, Poached Egg Avocado amp; Hollandaise, Oh My Goat Tartine, Fig, Avo amp; Feta and their to die for Acai bowls (see the pics!). BTW, vegan customers rave about their vegan hot dogs and vegan burgers.

Needing fuel after a vigorous morning workout? Try Pure Living Paleo Protein Pancakes (with or without the chocolate sauce) or their free-range scrambled eggs with fresh herbs.

Your other delicious options include the outside-the-box sandwich and wrap combos, Vietnamese Tofu noodles, Chili Con Carne, Vegan Chili Sin Carne, Fresh Grouper Fish Cakes and many more. And we absolutely HAVE to mention the Ultimate Vegan Lisa which is a gluten-free buckwheat pancake filled with falafels, guacamole, fresh greens and their signature chimichurri sauce.

Feeling like a refreshing summer drink? Take advantage of their generous assortment of cold-pressed juices and superfood smoothies. Our flat-out favorites are Reload, Zest of Zen and Pure Power. There’s even a high-end dosage zero (no-sugar) Prosecco somewhere on the back of the shelves if you feel like celebrating.

How about stepping out of your comfort zone and trying a Tigernut Milk Latte or a Golden Latte, which is one of the most effective flue fighters out there.

Not a fan of healthy food? Come to Pure Living and you will be converted.


<strong>Il Kantra Lido, Gozo</strong>
[gallery ids="4762,4763,4746" type="rectangular"]
Picture yourself dining perched on a cliff by the water’s edge with a breath-taking view over the Mediterranean sea? Being part of the legendary Ta’ Cenc Hotel, Il-Kantra Lido/Beach Club is a “must” when visiting Gozo. Built on low-laying cliffs between two beautiful inlets Mgarr Xini and Kantra, the restaurant faces the sea offering a view of the Fessej Rock and a distant glimpse of Comino and northern Malta.
Open throughout the summer season (commencing at Easter and ending in late October), il Kantra Lido is a Mediterranean style bar and grill restaurant with an array of sea food, excellent fresh local fish, grilled meat dishes, delicious pasta variations prepared by chefs from Sicily, and a multitude of crisp, fresh salads with a generous base of local vegetables, all of which can be enjoyed with excellent wine in a fabulous setting. The restaurant is vegetarian friendly and offers gluten-free options as well. Upon arriving, you will be met by attentive and jovial staff members or even cordially greeted by the owner himself.
Il Kantra is an excellent choice on sweltering summer days as the top of the cliff offers a lovely breeze. You can sit comfortably in the shade sampling local wine or rent a sunbed near the cliff’s edge and soak up the sun while enjoying the view and feeling on the top of the world. At any given moment, you can take the steps down to the inlet where you will find crystal clear waters beckoning you to jump in and refresh. It must be noted though that this swimming area is for experienced swimmers and is not recommended for young children and the elderly.
Due to its strikingly beautiful albeit remote location, the Lido/Beach club is a generally peaceful area even during the high season for those seeking a secluded place to eat, enjoy wine and relax. The only time Il Kantra experienced a wake of bustling energy was during the filming of By The Sea when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were spotted in villages of Sannat and the neighboring Mgarr Xini.
Feeling adventurous? Take the dirt road from the Ta’ Cenc Hotel down to the inlets, and we promise this exotic al fresco dining experience will become one of the highlights of your trip.
<strong>Caffe Berry</strong>
[gallery ids="4748,4749,4747" type="rectangular"]
Caffe Berry is not just about getting your morning coffee fix, it is an experience! The quaint little cafe was rated 5 of 5 on Trip Advisor and is deemed by locals and visitors alike the “best little coffee shop in the world”, “the best Italian espresso on the island” “stellar products and service”, “the most delicious nutty coffees”. Skeptical? Save your opinion till you have tried their Berrychino Pistachio Latte, their Berrychino Hazelnut Latte or their summer hits: Iced Hazelnut or Pistachio Mocha.
Not a fan of Arabica? Looking for “healthier” options? Kick-start your morning with their Power Lattes: beetroot, turmeric, ginger or spirulina.
Your other choices are tea, fresh fruit smoothies, green juices, the best freshly squeezed orange juice in Sliema (we can personally attest to that) and of course, numerous dreamy pastry varieties: all homemade with spelt flour, non-refined sugars and fresh local organic ingredients. Gluten-free and vegan options are always available. Their most beloved treats appear to be the Bronte pistachio vegan tart, dark chocolate brownie with fresh peaches and organic almonds and their one of a kind tiramisu: alcohol- and refined sugar- free, made with organic rice and spelt flour, free range eggs and blue Arabica coffee.
All coffee lovers, foodies, health nuts and mindful living practitioners, welcome to the Caffee Berry experience! Stop by, sample the exotic blends, chat with the lovely owner herself, find out about her coffee philosophy, meet fascinating characters from all walks of live, enjoy! When you are at the airport about to leave the island, we can guarantee this little blue coffee shop will still be on your mind.

First used by the Knights of St John for its moisturising properties, and later by farmers as a boundary to deter intruders from entering, the prickly pear fruit has more to offer than meets the eye. The prickly pear is also believed to have several medicinal properties and is sometimes used to help cure stomach aches, inflammations and insect bites.

<span style="font-size:large;"><b>Celebrate Independence Day </b></span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BeJF71oDnB1/?utm_source=ig_share_sheetamp;igshid=rody3r4qyded
<span style="font-size:large;">The Independence monument commemorating this historic day can be found in Floriana, in front of the public garden area known as </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>The Mall</i></span><span style="font-size:large;"> and facing the entrance into Valletta. On Independence Day, several activities and events are held in and around Valletta to celebrate. </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>Festivals Malta</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">, a branch of the Maltese Arts Council, will be organising public arts events and visitors can </span><span style="font-size:large;">expect impromptu celebrations to pop up across the island. We suggest heading up to the Floriana/Valletta area early throughout the early morning to make the most of the celebratory atmosphere before moving on to the next stop on our itinerary. </span>

<span style="font-size:large;">After a morning well-spent partaking in the outdoor events, we recommend paying a visit to </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>The Malta Experience </i></span><span style="font-size:large;">located in the St. Elmo’s Bastions for an interactive and informative journey through the Maltese Islands’ past.

Tickets also include a guided tour through the</span><span style="font-size:large;"><i> La Sacra Infermeria</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">.

<span style="font-size:large;">For an even more in-depth journey into the Maltese Islands’ intricate past, visitors might want to pay a visit to Fort St. Elmo. Renowned for protecting Malta throughout the Great Siege of 1565, Fort St. Elmo was strategically built to oversee and protect the Marsamxett Harbour, as well as the Grand Harbour. Today, the Fort is known as a historic building that houses Malta’s National War Museum and is famous for being a site used for national events. It has even been used in production filming! Additionally, visitors can request to visit the ramparts – a rewarding trip that features a splendid view of the Valletta waterfront. </span>

<span style="font-size:large;">An active, eventful day calls for a hearty dinner! The Valletta Waterfront is the ideal way to end a day exploring Malta’s capital. Stroll down the historic promenade and choose one of the many dining establishments for your dinner pick. The Valletta Waterfront marries dining, architecture, and history for a memorable evening. You’ll be eating right under the refurbished Pinto Vaults, with their colourful façades and set in a location that provides breath-taking views. The three cities are located on the opposite side of the shore and the waterfront gives a sprawling view of the Grand Harbour, which makes for a beautiful place to experience Malta’s sunset skies. </span>

            [content] => With epic beach club parties signaling the end of summer season in Malta, you may be feeling that all the fun is over now. Yet do not despair, we have plenty of excitement in store for you this coming fall season. All you have to do is take the ferry over to the island of Gozo. Whether you are a nature lover, a history buff, looking for art scene, culture or good time on a sail boat, Gozo has a bit of everything for everyone.
Let us give you the rundown of fall 2018 highlights on the Island of Gozo.
<b>Gozo Walks with Ivy</b>
Fall is the perfect time for exploring the islands outdoors. The weather is mostly sunny with clear skies and mild temps making it perfect for hiking, picnics, magnificent sunsets and lounging on the beach while soaking up the last of the gentle rays. The island of Gozo is full of hidden gems awaiting to be discovered by you: quaint towns with restaurants and bakeries off the beaten tourist path, pretty rock-enclosed beaches, spectacular nature trails with unique flora and fauna offering breath-taking views of the cliffs. None of the above are advertised online or in the mass tourism brochures. Feeling like an authentic Gozo adventure with cliff hikes, picnics, swims in exotic inlets, tastings of local produce and wine? Contact Ivy for a private tour: ivyevison@yahoo.com
<b>Historical Treasures of Gozo. </b>

If cliffs and beaches are not your cup of tea, the island of Gozo also offers a wealth of history and tradition. The warm, beautiful October days are ideal for visiting the island’s historical treasures. Once in Gozo, the first thing you will probably notice is the unique and distinguished shape of the Citadel (Cittadella), the highest structure on the island. The Citadel is an ancient fortress containing a whole city within its walls. It is believed to have been inhabited since the Bronze Age and has been listed as a non-active fortress for only about the last 150 years. Only a few families reside within the walls of the ancient fortress city today. Upon entering the Cittadella, you will have the opportunity to visit fascinating historical and architectural monuments such as the Old Prison, the Grain Silos, the Old Gunpowder Magazine, even a World War II shelter and a number of small museums: the Gozo Nature Museum, the Museum of Archeology, the Folklore Museum and others. Apart from its rich history, the Cittadella offers breath-taking views of the island’s landscape, encounters of rare flora and fauna species typical to the region and an assortment of cafes, restaurants and gift shops.
<img src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ggantija_temples_2.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-4808 size-full" height="2698" alt="Ggantija_Temples_2" width="4872">

Ggantija Temples is another experience you don’t want to miss when visiting Gozo. These megalithic temples from the New Stone Age are older than the pyramids of Egypt and Stonehenge. The findings suggest that the temples were used for religious rituals and ceremonies such as fertility rites as one can find fire hearths, holes in the floor most likely meant for liquid offerings and the evidence of animal bones implying animal sacrifices were performed. Right next to the Ggantija Temples you will find the Ta’ Kola Windmill which you can visit with the same ticket. The windmill was originally build during the Knights’ Period but had to be reconstructed later. Ta’ Kola Windmill is also one of few windmills that have survived. It is named after its last miller Zeppu ta’ Kola who took over the reparation of various destroyed and neglected windmills after the World War II. The Ta’ Kola Windmill offers an interesting historical account of the island’s bread, olive and wine culture and the typical lifestyle of the Gozitans.

Another immensely popular sacred religious site is Gozo is the Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary or Our Lady of Ta’ Pinu, which has been a beloved site for pilgrims and believers in miracles for centuries. In the year 1883 a woman from a near-by village heard the voice of the Blessed Virgin Mary beckoning her to visit the tiny chapel. Over the years multiple miracles were recounted in connection with the chapel such as recoveries from illnesses, the gift of fertility being restored and protection of soldiers in times of war.
Eventually the original chapel was replaced by an impressive Roman Catholic Basilica built between the years 1920-1931, yet the original foundation of the chapel was preserved, parts of which can still be seen today behind the altar. Once you enter the basilica you will be astounded by its opulent architecture, the grand sculptures, the six mosaics and painted windows. Yet the most intriguing aspect of the church are the two prayer rooms on either side of the altar. The walls of these two rooms are covered with recent and past stories, photos and other objects of evidence of miracles and answered prayers, such a regaining ability to walk, full accident recoveries, business and personal success stories and a multitude of blessings of every kind. The interior of the basilica is also being referred to as an “Oasis of Peace” offering a place for quiet reflection and meditation away from every day noises, chaos and troubles.
<b>Art and Culture Evens in Gozo Fall 2018</b>
<img src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fm.jpg" class="wp-image-4810 aligncenter size-full" height="244" alt="fm.jpg" width="365">

<span lang="mt-MT">Birgufest is a celebration of culture, art, and most importantly of the beauty of the historic walled city of Vittoriosa, known to the locals as Birgu. Vittoriosa is one of Malta’s oldest cities, having been the seat of the Knights of Malta before the city of Valletta was built. Nowadays this miniscule city is as quaint as they get, its alleyways twisting this way and that, leading you to unexpected beautiful sights. During the annual Birgufest, this city is illuminated by hundreds of candles, which replace the usual streetlamps. This creates a wonderful, intimate atmosphere, heightened by the various art and music performances throughout the streets. Food stalls will also be available throughout the city, while entrances to museums and historical buildings will be discounted. </span>

<span lang="mt-MT">During the rule of Grand Master Perellos, it is said that cocoa beans, a luxury at the time, were stored in the town of Hamrun, in the area known as ‘Tas-Samra’. This connection birthed the Hamrun Chocolate Festival, a yearly event of delicious chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate! This year the festival will be celebrating its 10 year mark, making celebrations bigger and better. Expect marvellous creations done entirely out of chocolate, as well as traditional Maltese delicacies which will make any chocaholic drool! This event is a chocolate lover’s dream, so prepare your palate, and indulge in the most opulent of desserts.</span>

            [blog_content] => <h2 >1. The Weather</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-658 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/grand-harbour-panoramic-view-2.jpg" alt="Grand Harbour Panoramic View (2)" width="5506" height="2256" />
Malta is in a state of perpetual summ er almost all year long. Known for its 300 days of sunshine, our sunny little island enjoys mild temperatures even during the months of January and February. Storms just pass by, and usually clear up after a few hours.

<h2 >2. The People</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-663 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/2014-10-25-20-23-05.jpg" alt="2014-10-25-20.23.05" width="640" height="360" />
The Maltese are known for their kind-heartedness and their eagerness to help anyone in need. You can ask a local for help with anything from directions, to where to visit. Chances are you'll make a Maltese friend pretty quickly (and get some expert local advice along the way)

<h2 >3. The Language</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-673 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/image.jpg" alt="image" width="2000" height="510" />
Don't get me wrong, the Maltese language is not an easy one to master, especially if you are here on a short trip. However, the majority of the population speaks English as their second language, as it is taught in schools from a very young age. English is also Malta's second official language.

<h2 >4. The Food</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-679 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/malta-pastizzi-3_800x533.jpg" alt="Malta-Pastizzi-3_800x533" width="800" height="533" />
Whether it's two freshly baked 'pastizzi' or a mouth-watering rabbit stew, Maltese cuisine is hearty and tasty. Combining Mediterranean elements with some British touches, our cuisine has borrowed something from all the countries we were colonised by in past years and is now typically ours. Make sure to get two baking hot date cakes from Valletta, and some fresh fish from Marsaxlokk!

<h2 >5. The History</h2>
<img src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/malta-120223-506-edit.jpg" alt="Malta-120223-506-Edit" width="1600" height="898" />
Malta is a history buff's paradise! From temples which out-date the pyramids of Egypt, to fortified cities - there is 3000 years of history clustered in the Maltese islands. The prehistoric temples are a definite must-see, and if you're short on time, a quick trip to Valletta will replenish all your historical needs, as there is something significant to behold at every corner.

<h2 >6. The Beaches</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-692 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ramla.jpg" alt="ramla" width="3264" height="2448" />
Known as being among Malta's major attractions, its myriad of beaches suit everyone's taste. From sandy beaches with sprawling reddish sand, to clean cut white rocky beaches, there is something for everyone. The northern part of Malta is where most beaches are located, however there are a few hidden gems in the southern part as well. Visit Mellieha Bay for a taste of the Maltese summer, or head to the northern-most Armier bay for crystal clear waters and white sand.

<h2 >7. The Nightlife</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-704 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/gianpula1.jpg" alt="gianpula" width="570" height="476" />
The Maltese clubbing scene has been rising steadily, and now rivals that of Ibiza and Ayia Napa as a clubbing paradise. Although the high season for this scene is undoubtedly the summer, many DJs, local and international, organize events all year long. The main hub for this scene is of course the notorious Paceville, which is flooded with people every weekend. Other places to try are Numero Uno in Ta' Qali, as well as Cafe del Mar in Qawra during the summer months.

<h2 >8. Its small size</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-718 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/14017140523_26a76158d8_b.jpg" alt="14017140523_26a76158d8_b" width="971" height="521" />
Malta covers just over 316 sq km, and can be crossed from Northern most tip to Southern most tip in less than 2 hours (given there is no traffic). This means that getting from one place to another is easy and quick. A 'long' commute for the Maltese consists of an hour-long car ride. We are minuscule compared to other countries, and there are even some cities which are bigger than the whole island! And with a population of over 400,000 people, it means that it is less crowded than most other cities too!

<h2 > 9. Gozo</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-721 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/gozo-habour_1854937b.jpg" alt="gozo-habour_1854937b" width="620" height="388" />

Malta's little sister island is a wonder in itself. With picturesque beaches, quaint harbours, sea-side towns and rural villages, Gozo is a tiny gem to be  explored.  Make sure to take a picture with the Azure Window in Dwejra, which made its big screen début in Game of Thrones. Mgarr ix-Xini Bay also served as a cinematic backdrop in 'By the Sea' filmed entirely on the island. Another plus - getting to Gozo by ferry offers you an unlimited view of all 3 islands, giving you a new perspective on the Maltese archipelago!

<h2 >10. Shortlets Malta</h2>

            [blog_content] => <h3>Malta - our little island in the middle of the vast Mediterranean Sea. Yet, many have not heard of it, do not know where it is, do not know of our language, do not know her people.</h3>
Here are some very quick facts, brushing up your skills on Malta and the Maltese:
<ol>
	<li>Malta is an independent island, of just 316 km<sup>2 </sup></li>
	<li>It is located towards the south of Sicily</li>
	<li>Malta has its own language, Maltese, which finds its origins in Semitic and Romance languages. Some English words have now been incorporated in the vocabulary as well.</li>
	<li>The Maltese islands are made up of 3 main islands; Malta, the biggest island in the archipelago; Gozo, the second biggest island of only 67 km sq; and Comino, the smallest, barely inhabited island.</li>
	<li>Malta has been colonized by many peoples over the years, the longest being by the Knights of St John, and by the British.</li>
	<li>Euro is the official currency as of 2008, with the Maltese Lira preceding it.</li>
	<li>Malta has a population of just over 400,000.</li>
	<li>The Capital City is Valletta, built by and named after the Grandmaster Jean Parisot de la Vallette.</li>
	<li>We drive on the left side of the road (or the wrong side of the road for many), a custom left by the British rule in Malta.</li>
	<li>Our climate is hot and dry in the Summer, and humid but mild in the Winter. Average temperature in Summer is of 32ºC, while in Winter it is of 14ºC.</li>
</ol>
Malta is much, much more than this - it is an island abounding in culture, history and art. It is made up of a fun-loving, caring people, who can squabble one minute and laugh the next. It is an island made up of sun, sea, and bright colours - from the traditional Luzzu boats to the brightly painted covered balconies. It is a treasure to be discovered, and to be treasured. There is something for absolutely everyone, from the quiet streets of the Silent City to the roaring, raging weekly summer Festas. Come and see for yourself!

		<!--<p>In the past few years, holiday rentals - be it apartments, condos or villas - have grown steadily in popularity as the most opted for accommodation choice. This trend has never been as en vogue as it is right now; whilst holiday homes have been around for many years, the surge and demand for more and more holiday rental property is a relatively new concept. Hotels are on the decline, while holiday rentals are on a steady incline. However, what makes a holiday rental such a favourable option, over an accommodation which offers breakfast and cleaning services on a daily basis?</p> -->

<!-- <h2 >1. Vacation Rentals actually cost less than hotels.</h2>
<img class="  wp-image-827 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/moneh.jpg" alt="moneh" width="666" height="443" />
<p>Are you counting your pennies and saving up every Euro for your upcoming holiday? (Aren't we all!). Indeed, everyone loves saving money. Why spend €500 when you could get the same deal for €250? Believe it or not, a vacation rental will cost you significantly less than a hotel would. Imagine being a family of 5 and renting a family room or else two rooms in a hotel. Family rooms are one of the most expensive options you can opt for when booking a hotel room, while the price of two rooms is obviously doubling all costs. Booking one 3-bedroom house will prove to be much, much cheaper - as you would be paying for the house, regardless of the amount of people. For example,  a family room in a typical 4-star hotel would cost you around €1600 for a week in July, while a 3-bedroom house, for the same dates, in the same area, would cost you around €950. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a hefty save of €650. Still convinced that a hotel is the best option?</p>

<h2 >2. You get so much more space!</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-842" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/home.jpg" alt="home" width="2509" height="1673" />
<p>If you could choose between having a whole apartment to yourself, or having a bedroom and en-suite bathroom, which one would you opt for? You know the answer, no need to spell it out for you. You get more than triple times the space you would get in a cramped hotel room, while paying significantly less! What's not to love?! Plus, you also get the added privacy of going in and out at whatever time you please (without any nosy Receptionists or Night Receptionists tutting and shaking their heads as you walk in barefooted at 5am). For you, dear parents - would you rather share a room with your kids, or having them share a room with each other, giving you some peace and quiet? Thought so  :)</p>

<h2 >3. Having a Kitchen, you'll save big bucks on food.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/food.jpg" alt="food" width="2000" height="1335" />
<p>I know, I know - who the hell wants to cook while they're on holiday?! People on a budget, that's who! Also, people who love to sleep in (alternatively missing breakfast cause you woke up after 10am), people visiting notoriously expensive cities (alternatively forking out ridiculous amounts of money for gourmet plates which barely fill you up), people with food intolerances (alternatively having to look  for specialised restaurants or having to ask each and every chef about how the food is prepared), and the list goes on and on. Need more convincing? Imagine waking up at whatever time you want to wake up, being unrestricted by breakfast times or dinner times, and eating whatever tickles your fancy, instead of eating from a set menu. Ah, the kitchen life!</p>

<h2 >4. Live like a local.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-875" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/local.jpg" alt="local" width="4000" height="2713" />
<p>Sure, your camera and back-pack will still give you away for the bright-eyed tourist that you are, however, nothing screams 'Tourist' more than a hotel. Want to mingle with locals? A hotel is generally the worst place to start. Locals do not frequent hotels for the same reason you do not hang around hotels in your city - cause you live there! Chances of meeting local people while staying in a hotel are slight. Living in a rental home puts you smack dab in the heart of the local scene - start with your neighbours - a friendly 'Good Morning' or 'Hello' can be an ice-breaker. Most people are willing to help, if you only have the nerve to ask. So fire away, ask any local you meet about the best hangouts in town and you will get top-notch advice. You can also eat as the locals do - buy fresh local produce, local bread - any local speciality. You will be experiencing much more than just a package holiday!</p>

<h2 >5. (Sometimes) Pets are welcome.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-884" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/pet.jpg" alt="pet" width="5377" height="3585" />
<p>True - this does not apply to each and every vacation rental, however rental home owners tend to be more flexible when it comes to allowing pets. Be prepared to pay a slightly higher security deposit, but you can get this back in full if your beloved pooch leaves everything intact. Hotels are way more fussy when it comes to allowing pets, and most of them flatly refuse to allow pets altogether. And let's face it, one of the hardest things about going on holiday is leaving your adorable four-legged friend behind, so why put yourself through that kind of trauma?</p>

<h2 >6. A WASHING MACHINE.</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-893" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/washer.jpg" alt="washer" width="5472" height="3648" />
<p>BYE RYAN-AIR OVERWEIGHT FEES! Why, why, why lug around a fortnight's worth of clothing, causing you to put on half your luggage's worth of clothes at the airport to avoid overweight fees, ending up with TONS of laundry to do as soon as you arrive home? WHY? Cause hotels have no washing machines, that's why. And because hotel laundry service is daylight robbery, that's why. Surprise surprise, you're most likely to find a washing machine (and sometimes a dryer too!) in every, single, rental home. This means that you can half your luggage weight by bringing a lot less clothes (leaving more room for mementos!), and you have very little laundry to do when you go back home. If that's not a sweet deal, we don't know what is.</p> -->

Stress can ruin you, in every possible way. Fortunately there is a solution to combat this stressful predator – a break from everyday life and day-to-day routine, which provides a much needed rest for mind, body and soul.  That is all well and good; I can hear you say, but what about the kids? True - what about the kids? Should holidays be child-free? Do parents deserve a break more than the children do? Would bringing the kids along actually increase stress levels? We sat down for a chat with Elaine Grech a therapist specialising in Family Issues, to get more insight about the love/hate relationship of the Family Holiday.

<strong>What constitutes a pleasant family holiday, in your opinion?</strong>

<strong>E.G.</strong>: I think that the families who manage to enjoy holidays the most are the ones who find a way of getting along, who manage to resolve the conflicts that they might have and which might arise, and who feel that their needs are being taken care of and catered for. Taking into consideration each family member’s needs during the planning of the holiday will ensure that there is something to please everyone, and thus the holiday is more pleasurable for all.

<strong>What psychological benefits can a family enjoy when going on a family holiday?</strong>

<strong>E.G.:</strong> When people look back on their childhood, they do not recollect material things; it is the memories which stand out mostly. These memories may be of the simplest things, such as going to the beach or cooking a pie together as a family, however it is these memories which stick the most through adulthood. By going on a family holiday, parents and children have time to dedicate for each other, without any external distractions such as work. Thus they create new, bonding memories, and manage to get involved in new experiences together as a family. The time invested in the family is beneficial to the whole household.

<strong>How does the holiday affect the psychological well-being of the parents, and of the children in the end?</strong>

<strong>E.G.:</strong> This is dependent on whose needs are being catered for during the holiday. As an example, in a family of two caregivers, where one lounges around and does nothing while the other takes care of the children and other chores, there will be no balance and this will create unhappiness in the whole family unit. If both caregivers support each other and help each other in their daily chores, then there is going to be a shared happiness between them and also with the children. The whole family has to work together as one team, including the children as well, thus giving them an idea of what it means to be a loving unit. It is also a good idea to include the children in choice-making, for example, giving them a choice between two parks, and letting them decide which one they prefer. This creates a sense of independence and also of importance in the children, instead of always tagging around wherever their caregivers choose to take them.



<strong>Does the holiday necessarily always have to be child oriented or are there particular ages when planning a holiday around the child’s needs is a must?</strong>

<strong>E.G.:</strong> There are different types of holidays. If the holiday is a family holiday, then yes, it is very important to include the children in the planning process, choose destinations which are child friendly, and choose child-friendly activities as much as possible. Bear in mind that the things you enjoy doing single, or with other adults – such as going to museums, art galleries, concerts – may not be enjoyable for the child as well. However, there can be instances where your needs and your child’s needs meet – for example I once went to a castle in Scotland; I loved it because of the medieval history and the children loved it because they could run around in the huge garden. You have to be flexible when travelling with children and keep in mind that activities which are constricted by time may not be suitable for them, as it adds extra pressure. Plan one activity a day, and be flexible as much as you can. Remember that is your child is frustrated and angry, you will probably end up this way too.

<strong>What kind of precautions should be taken by parents to ensure the best possible vacation for all family members?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>The best way is to plan ahead and make sure that the children are properly entertained, especially while travelling by airplane or by train, so that they do not get frustrated from boredom. I have had some families which some traumatised from a family holiday, after horrifying long journeys with kids in the car or the plane.  Planning ahead is the key. Pack some activities they love, and let them pack a bag each (as long as what they pack abides by travelling regulations). I give each of my children a travelling bag which they can then fill with any favourite toys and activities they want, so that they don’t get bored. This gives them responsibility as well; as they make sure they are bringing what is most important to them.

<strong>Family relationships can be even put on strain since the holiday will deviate from the normal routine of everyday life. How can one compensate for this, especially with regards to children?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>Reflect and set out the expectations for the holiday beforehand. For example, in a traditional family setting with a working father and stay at home mother – would the father spend the whole day doing nothing while on holiday since he does not have to work, while the mother carries on with her daily routine of taking care of the children, cooking, cleaning – these roles should be shared during a holiday environment, as the routine is somewhat changed. The sleeping pattern of the children is also another thing to bear in mind when planning a holiday, since there are no school days. The planning of this has to be thought of beforehand, also with regards to travelling time.

<strong>How often is it recommended to go on family holidays?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>This obviously depends on the financial situation of the family, a family who manages to take regular family holidays is truly blessed, as these offer new experiences and broaden the horizons of all the members of the family, especially the children. Unfortunately not all families can afford a family holiday, however even a local trip can benefit the family as a whole. It has to be made sure that in order to take a holiday the other family’s needs are not put under strain. However, money spent on holidays is invested in memories, and never goes to waste. Holidays can be educational and are mind-opening to the children.

<strong>Do psychological benefits increase when travelling with extended family members (grandparents, aunts, uncles), or should family trips be kept to the immediate family members (parents, children)?</strong>

<strong>E.G.: </strong>It depends on the type of relationship there is between these family members, so it varies from family to family. In our culture in Malta, it is quite common to be connected to our extended family, so being on holiday with them can work out as long as the family members get along well. One must see that all the family members share and uphold the same core values, as sharing a home with someone who holds different values from you could be difficult. However, as long as differences can be respected and boundaries are set, a family holiday with the extended family can be a very beneficial experience.

            [blog_content] => Food is not just a means of nourishment for many. It is treated like a social vehicle; the act of eating is used as a medium - to meet up with family or friends, to discuss business, to celebrate an occasion. People seem to bond over food, making it a powerful social tool. Now imagine having this tool taken away from you, being unable to enjoy a bite to eat at a restaurant without fearing for your life.  Welcome to the life of an allergy sufferer.
Many people nowadays throw the word ‘allergy’ around without really knowing what it means. There is often a confusion between the words ‘allergy’ and ‘intolerance’. Someone who suffers from an intolerance – be it lactose intolerance, gluten and wheat intolerance, yeast intolerance – will feel ill after ingesting these products.  Intolerance is a sign that the body is not capable of digesting the food eaten or that the food being eaten irritates the digestive system.  A person who suffers from an allergy however, is prone to feel ill when an allergen is ingested too, yet there is also an impending life-threatening reaction connected to the allergen.  This is caused when the body’s immune system, which usually wards off infections, sees the food being ingested as an invader. This leads to an allergic reaction in the body – which reaction can cause symptoms such as breathing problems, throat tightness, coughing, vomiting, abdominal pain, swelling and a drop in blood pressure. Allergic reactions are not always consistent; someone who has had a mild allergic reaction before may have a life threatening reaction the next time.  Even contamination of utensils and equipment may lead to a grave allergic reaction, and thus precautions must be taken. Yet, living in a world where eating is a social activity, someone suffering from a food allergy may often feel left out, his/her (very serious) needs neglected.
We spoke to Dr. Mario Aquilina, a Lecturer at the University of Malta and father of a 5 year-old boy who has been suffering from a food allergy since he was just a year old. His young son had to be admitted to hospital as a toddler when he had an allergic reaction to a particular ingredient, which at the time could not be isolated. This caused the family to undergo a huge overhaul in their lives, removing all traces of food which might trigger a reaction.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-948" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/food1.jpg" alt="Food1.jpg" width="4000" height="2667" />
<strong>What changes have you made in your everyday life to make sure your son can eat healthily and safely?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>You have to be prepared to read and understand ingredients on products, as sometimes a different jargon is used in labelling. We had to eliminate certain products produced in Malta unfortunately, since the labelling on these products is not always thorough, and thus not always safe. We have had to be more careful about cross-contamination of kitchen utensils and pots and pans, making sure to clean everything well before reusing it to prepare something else. It is important to read and to be informed about the issue as much as possible and to hand-pick restaurants before eating out.  Travelling has become complicated; however we usually opt for self-catering apartments when going abroad, so that we are 100% safe in regards to food, which we prepare ourselves.
<strong>What might help to increase awareness about food allergies and their serious consequences especially in Malta?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>Awareness is increasing from when my son was first diagnosed with his allergy, almost 5 years ago. Many restaurants now write on their menus that allergy sufferers need to speak to the waiter or the chef; however they are often not willing to take the risk and advertise themselves as ‘allergy-friendly’ as it then puts a lot of responsibility on the restaurateurs, who would obviously not want to be held accountable should someone have an allergic reaction. I myself have spoken with various hotel and restaurant managers regarding this issue, as, if viewed in the long-run, catering for allergy sufferers benefits their business rather than hinders it. If, for example, there is a family of 5 persons, including a person suffering from an allergy who cannot eat at a particular restaurant because it does not cater for allergy sufferers, then this restaurant would have lost a potential table of 5 clients. Investing in different pans and separate cooking oil may seem burdensome and wasteful for many restaurant owners; however this proves to be beneficial in the long run, as instead of shunning people away by not catering for everyone’s needs, you then actually draw people in. Awareness is increasing in Malta, but the Government has to implement changes on the labelling of Maltese products, providing an allergen sheet as in the UK. The Facebook page I set up, ‘Eating Out with Special Dietary Requirements’ mentions places which have offered a pleasant experience when eating out with my son. A lot of restaurants are not yet fully willing to advertise themselves that they do indeed cater for allergy sufferers, but people on social media can share their experiences, good or bad, so that more people are informed about which restaurants they can choose.

<strong>What do allergy sufferers, especially foreigners, have to look for when choosing a restaurant?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>In my opinion, you cannot enjoy eating somewhere unless you fully trust that your needs are going to be catered for as you require, without cross-contamination of utensils and equipment, and with proper care in the selection of ingredients. A restaurant must be researched before, and it is best to call before making the reservation, so that you can state clearly that there will be someone who is allergic to some ingredients in your party, to see if the restaurant will be able to cope with these demands. Once at the restaurant, it is imperative to ask again, and to state again which ingredients cannot be ingested by said person. It is best to talk both to the person in charge – be it a head waiter or chef – as well as to the waiter serving you, to make sure that there is more than one person who is aware of the situation. This way the allergy sufferer can put his/her mind at rest and truly enjoy the experience of dining, and the whole party can enjoy the meal together. Unfortunately sometimes there is miscommunication between the waiter and the chef, especially if the waiter is not yet trained enough. Allergy sufferers are sometimes mistaken for fussy or picky eaters, and the staff thinks that they are merely complaining or being a nuisance. Having an allergy is a far-cry from being fussy. It is important that you explain what the situation is, and how serious the reaction might be should the allergen be ingested in some way, or if some equipment is cross-contaminated. It is your right to feel comfortable with what you are eating and it is the establishment’s duty to offer food which is safe to eat.

<strong>Which restaurants have you found to provide the best service when catering for allergy sufferers?</strong>
<strong>M.A.: </strong>There are a number of restaurants which have been indeed very welcoming and very considerate when dealing with people with special dietary requirements, most of which I mention in my Facebook Page ‘Eating Out with Special Dietary Requirements’ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HappyRestaurants/?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/HappyRestaurants/?fref=ts</a>. Here I list my experiences in restaurants across Malta and Gozo which have provided excellent service and a good choice of food catering for different dietary requirements. A quick mention - Amorino, the ice-cream shop in Republic Street, Valletta, is very helpful as it has an allergen sheet where one can see each different ingredient in the various ice-creams they offer.

            [blog_content] => Kitesurfing is a relatively new sport, becoming a mainstream sport in 1999. It is a surface water sport which combines elements from wakeboarding, windsurfing, surfing and paragliding. A kitesurfer uses the power of the wind with the kite to propel him/herself across the water, while also using the waves to be able to jump higher. It is not a sport for the faint-hearted, and it is certainly not a sport to try on your own, as there could be some serious injuries. Water-sports have always been a part of island living, and having so many beaches to choose from in such short distances, makes Malta an ideal location for practicing water-sports.

We spoke to Ralph Vella, company director of Shortlets Malta Ltd., and avid kitesurfer, about this fairly new water-sport.

<strong>What drew you to kitesurfing?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Back in 2002, when I started kitesurfing, this sport was very new, and the only things we knew about it were what had seen from the internet. I was very interested and wanted to try it out, since I had already been keen on windsurfing. A small demonstration was set up in Malta by a kitesurfer from the UK, and he showed us what to do and we had some equipment which we could try out.

<strong>Do you need to have a background in some other type of sport to be able to kitesurf?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>It is not particularly necessary; however, if you have a background in wakeboarding or in surfing, this will help you greatly with your board skills. If you have even flown a stunt kite or a traction kite, you will have a better idea of how to handle the kite as well. I did not have either of the two, which made it a bit harder for me, and since the sport was just beginning and the equipment was still quite primitive, it took me about 2 years to learn how to properly practice this sport.

<strong style="line-height:1.7;">Do you need to take specific lessons to practice kitesurfing, or can you learn on your own?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Yes, you need to take lessons, even though I learned on my own. Today there are IKO (International Kitesurfing Organisation) Instructors in Malta, who are certified instructors specifying in this sport. These instructor make the sport safer, and they teach you all you need to know to feel safe while kitesurfing. One of the drawbacks of kitesurfing in Malta is that the wind is always onshore, so if something goes wrong while practicing the sport, you can be dragged on to the beach. It is important to always know exactly what you are doing while kitesurfing.

<strong>Does this sport require only a kite and a surfboard?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>No, these are the two main pieces of equipment you need, however there are different types for different situations. For example while kitesurfing you will need more than one kite for different winds; the stronger the wind, the smaller the kite has to be. In my case I have three kites, a 14sqm for light wind, an 11sqm for medium winds and a 7sqm for strong wind, Force 7 and rough conditions. There are also different kinds of boards – usually the most basic board is a twin-tip, meaning it can be steered in both directions, having no front-end or back-end. Then there are more specialised surf boards for riding waves, however these are usually used by more advanced riders who want to have a further challenge while kitesurfing to ride the waves with the kite, which is a more difficult thing to do.

<strong>What safety precautions do you need to take prior attempting to kitesurf?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>The most important thing is knowing the direction of the wind, and making sure that the wind is a good condition for kitesurfing. Then you need to choose the right equipment. For example, if you are going kitesurfing on a day when the wind is onshore Force 5, you need to choose the right location, the right size of kite and board, and you need to pay attention to other people in the water. When jumping you need to make sure that there is nothing and no one downwind of you, so that you do not get hurt, otherwise it is very easy to injure yourself or those around you.

<strong>Is kitesurfing suitable for anyone to try?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Kitesurfing is not ideal for children, as you have to be attentive and know what you’re doing at all times. The youngest kitesurfer I met in Malta was 15 years old. However this does not mean that you cannot kitesurf if you are young, you just need to be very careful and stay alert, as it can be very dangerous is you do not know what you are doing. The oldest kitesurfer I know is a friend of mine, who is about 45 years old, so not too old either. In Malta we were only 5 people in the beginning, when the sport was just starting; but now in the last 5 years or so, we have gone up to about 50 people. Obviously we are never all together on the beach! The most we have been is about 20 kites.

<strong>Can you kitesurf alone? Or should there always be someone with you to help you if needed?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>You can kitesurf alone theoretically, however I never did, as to launch a kite on your own you have to use a kind of anchor, or at least a rope tied to something heavy, and since the beaches in Malta are quite small this can be a bit dangerous, especially if you are alone. Usually, I do not make specific plans to meet up with other kitesurfers but I always seem to find someone practicing the sport whenever I go. Unfortunately there is no Kitesurfing Club yet in Malta; however you can always find the same group of people kitesurfing here and there. There are quite a few people in Malta who have tried it out, however it is only a few who are still practicing it regularly.

<strong>What makes kitesurfing more challenging than windsurfing?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>I do not personally think it is more challenging than windsurfing; however they are different from each other. For windsurfing you need to have windier conditions than for kitesurfing. What makes kitesurfing more challenging in Malta is the lack of space, as for kitesurfing you need at least 30m of beach to open your lines, whereas for windsurfing you can go off the rocks. In Malta, especially in summer when the beaches are packed, we have to find our own solutions as to how to launch the kite and where to land it, as there are the swimmers only zones in use as well. I would say kitesurfing is more of a winter sport, at least in Malta.

<strong>Is Malta an ideal location for kitesurfing?</strong>

<strong>R.V.: </strong>Malta is ideal yes, as it is an island and you can get all the wind directions in different locations. There is no ‘best’ beach, as it mostly depends on the wind direction, but the most ideal beach for learning especially, is (Ghadira) Mellieha Bay, simply because it is the largest beach on the island. My favourite beach has to be Riviera Bay, which is one of the hardest places to kitesurf in Malta, as when the wind is strong very big waves form there. You can use these waves as a makeshift ramp to push you up, and you can time the jump with the kite together with the wave so you get really high jumps. However, this is best to attempt if you are skilled in the sport and you are an experienced rider.

            [blog_content] => A trip to Gozo should be on everyone’s bucket-list. Our little sister island, known for its magnificent three hills, is a natural splendour, still very much raw and unspoilt. The Gozitans are friendly and welcoming (albeit being somewhat quieter than their Maltese neighbours), and the island offers a totally different feel than Malta does. Even if you can visit for just a day, it is still worth the while. A rental car/jeep is a must if you want to see as many sights as possible, and you will be surprised to find that Gozitan roads make for a far smoother ride than Maltese ones! The island is just begging to be explored, so buckle up, map in hand, and begin your journey!

<strong><u>Getting there</u></strong>

You can reach Gozo either by sea, or by helicopter. There is no airport on this teeny island, so a plane is out of the question. The ferry to Gozo departs every 30 minutes from Cirkewwa Harbour, which is the northernmost part of Malta. The harbour offers some great views of both Comino and Gozo (great for some photos while waiting for the ferry!), and there are several small boats which depart from here as well, some which can be hired for a private day tour, and some which can take you to Comino. The Gozo ferry takes about 20 minutes to cross the waters separating both islands. This gives you plenty of time for more photos (you are on holiday after all!), and also allows you to admire the beauty of our beloved islands from a nautical point of view.

<strong><u>Landed at Mġarr</u></strong>

As soon you see the Ferry heading into the Harbour, head to your car, and make your way off the boat and onto Gozo. You will be greeted by a Gothic looking church, which looks over the Harbour giving you a sense of protection from above. This church is dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes, and has been welcoming sailors and visitors to the Harbour since 1888. The ride from Mġarr is a steep uphill, and there are some breath-taking views to take in as you go along (Driver safety first and foremost! Drivers should not take their eyes off the road!).

[caption id="attachment_media-8" align="aligncenter" width="4608"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/cittadella_aerial_view_6.jpg" alt="Cittadella_Aerial_View_6.jpg" width="4608" height="2592" /> Citadella, Victoria, Gozo[/caption]

<strong><u>Victoria, Gozo</u></strong>

All roads lead to Victoria! Or Rabat, as us Maltese call it. Gozo’s capital is easily reachable; all you have to do is drive straight on from Mġarr. The Gozitan capital is the busiest part of Gozo, and the most commercial one as well. But don’t let the shops fool you; there is a hidden gem among the narrow streets of Victoria. The Ċittadella is a fortified city situated on top of the highest hill of Victoria, reminiscent of Mdina. Until 1637, the island’s inhabitants were required to spend each night inside the Citadel walls, as there were frequent pirate assaults and kidnappings. There is the magnificent Cathedral which is well-worth a visit, as well as several Museums to see, such as the Museum of Archaeology and of Folklore. Take a look from the Citadel’s walls to behold all of Gozo beneath you!

<strong><em>Interesting fact:</em></strong> There are also fields in the Citadel, which were designed to provide nourishment should the island be kept under siege inside the Citadel for a long time!



[caption id="attachment_media-10" align="aligncenter" width="5948"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/azure_window__dwejra_70.jpg" alt="Azure_Window__Dwejra_70.jpg" width="5948" height="3965" /> Gozo's most famous landmark! The Azure Window[/caption]

<strong><u>Dwejra and the Azure Window</u></strong>

Going on straight through the small village of San Lawrenz, you will behold what is perhaps one of the most recognised images concerning the Maltese Islands. The Azure Window is one of Gozo’s landmarks, forever present on postcards, adverts and brochures. The world-famous window is regrettably falling to its demise, as more and more rock is eroded every year – making the bridge over the window more of a hazard as time goes by. However, admire it while you can, and take as many pictures as you can! The Window can be viewed in all its splendour from a cliff just in front, it is quite a climb; however it is worth every step. Dwejra, where the Window is located, is also famous for its Inland Sea, which is a natural phenomenon occurring when the sea-water from the open sea passes through a small, cave-like crack in the cliffs, and forms a clear-water lagoon just a few minutes away from the Azure Window. The Sea is worth a visit, as there are some boat tours departing from it as well. For a few Euros, you can pass through the small cave like opening and take a tour of the caves of the area, as well as see the gigantic Window from sea-level (Prepare yourself, this will make you feel very, very small!).

[caption id="attachment_media-12" align="aligncenter" width="8192"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_3318.jpg" alt="IMG_3318.JPG" width="8192" height="1812" /> Fungus Rock on the left, Azure Window on the right[/caption]

While going back to your parked car, don’t forget to take a look (and maybe a photo or two!) of the Fungus Rock, an isolated rock in the middle of the sea, which is home to a sporadic plant which the Knights used in many of their medicines.

<strong><em>Interesting fact:</em> </strong>The Knights guarded Fungus Rock day and night to prevent theft of the plants, which is said to have been punishable by death! It is still today illegal to climb the Rock, as it is protected for its wildlife.

[caption id="attachment_media-14" align="aligncenter" width="4608"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ggantija_temple_aerial_view_6.jpg" alt="Ggantija_Temple_Aerial_View_6.JPG" width="4608" height="2592" /> Awe-Inspiring Ggantija Temples[/caption]

<strong><u>Ġgantija Temples</u></strong>

Regaining your breath after the spectacular views at Dwejra, you can head over to the village of Xagħra, home to the neolithic temples of Ġgantija. These temples are the earliest of their kind on our islands, are older than the pyramids of Egypt and are the second oldest manmade religious structures in the world! Walking through, and seeing a structure built more than 5500 years ago, has a way of humbling one somehow.  The tickets are a bit on the pricey side, but it is well worth the money. The temples were constructed before the invention of the wheel, so the builders used stone spheres to transport the immense blocks to their desired place. These spheres are still visible today!

<strong><em>Interesting fact:</em></strong> The word ‘Ġgantija’ in Maltese is a derivative of the word ‘Ġgant’ meaning ‘Giant’, as the Gozitans used to think that the temples were built by a giantess who lived on a diet of broad beans and bread!

[caption id="attachment_1036" align="alignnone" width="4608"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1036" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ramla_lhamra_2.jpg" alt="Ramla_lHamra_2" width="4608" height="3072" /> Ramla l-Hamra - The Red Beach[/caption]

<strong><u>Ramla l-Ħamra Bay</u></strong>

Just a few minutes’ drive away from the majestic temples, down a winding country road, is one of the most beautiful bays of the Maltese Islands. Ramla l-Ħamra Bay is a beautiful stretch of beach, characterised by its striking red sand. The water itself is sometimes dangerous to swim in, as there are a lot of strong currents in the bay – however you can check whether it is safe or not with the Information Centre just off of the bay. If you have kids, they will love building sand-castles in sand that seems like it was made for that purpose. Also, red sandcastles make for some lovely photos! This beach is the perfect place to unwind and relax to the sound of the crashing waves.

<strong><em>Interesting fact: </em></strong>There is a cave near this beach which is said to have been the home of Calypso, the beautiful nymph who held Odysseus with her for 7 years, while he was on his way home from the battle of Troy!

[caption id="attachment_1039" align="aligncenter" width="3260"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/xlendi2.jpg" alt="xlendi2.jpg" width="3260" height="2445" /> Sunset at Xlendi Bay[/caption]

<strong><u>Xlendi Bay</u></strong>

What better place to end your jam-packed Gozo tour, than Xlendi Bay? The bay is a perfect spot to watch the sunset, as the sun seems to melt into the sea just between the two cliff-sides of Xlendi. The bay itself is a quaint little thing, not that great to swim in, especially if you like your beaches sandy. There are some lovely restaurants along the water though, and there is an astonishing walk way, which leads to the edge of the cliffs. The colossal cliffs plunging into the sea make for a great backdrop for a photo as well! The path winds on into a small creek between the cliff faces, where the sea-water makes its way, creating a lovely valley called Kantra.

<strong><em>Interesting fact: </em></strong>The Tower on top of the opposite cliffs over Kantra valley is the oldest freestanding watch tower in Gozo. It was built in 1650 to warn the island of any incoming pirates!

<strong><u>Back to the Motherland</u></strong>

Take a deep breath and inhale all of the beauty that Gozo offered you during this day. There is still much, much more to see, however, we’ll leave that for another day-trip in the future. Our sister island may be small in size, but she is great in character. It is an island full to the brim with hidden splendour, and not-so-hidden gorgeousness as well. Please do your best to keep this untarnished natural beauty as you found it, so that we can visit again and be in awe of all things Gozitan once again. Until next time!

            [blog_content] => Children scream in delight, zooming past with a handful of paper confetti in their hands. Fireworks spiral their way into the air, leaving behind a trail of gleaming light. Band players huff and puff away at their trumpets and trombones, the odd thump from the bass drum echoing. Vendors call out to eager buyers, proudly showing off their wares. The statue of the patron saint looks on, quietly admiring its loyal subjects. The smell of nougat and fresh date cakes fills the air. And to think that this occurrence happens every week during the Maltese summer!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1047" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/enjoying-the-feast.jpg" alt="Enjoying the feast.jpg" width="2848" height="4256" />

The village festa is all this and more. It is a weekly celebration, an all-out festivity which unites (and in some cases divides, but more on that later) the village community. The festa is first and foremost a celebration of the patron saint’s day, and religious commemorations still take place in the beautifully decorated churches. Each town or village has at least one patron saint, with some having two or even three. Each Sunday during the summer, you are guaranteed to find a festa taking place somewhere in Malta. Sometimes there are more than one festa taking place on the same day, especially if the churches are dedicated to the same patron saint. It is a hub of activity, offering something for everyone. Hearty food, plenty of drink and great company are usually at the centre of each festa. It is an intrinsically Mediterranean festivity, combining all the constituents of the traditional Mediterranean character – loud music and cheer, good food, friendly people and a lively atmosphere.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1049" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/feast_decorations_4.jpg" alt="Feast_Decorations_4.jpg" width="3200" height="2119" />

These celebrations date back to the 1500s, when the Knights of St John celebrated a few selected feast days with outdoor festivities. In 1777, Grand Master de Rohan encouraged the Maltese populace to take part and celebrate these religious events with great fanfare, leading up to the jovial affairs they are today. The first celebrated festas used string instruments, and traditional Maltese instruments such as ‘iż-żaqq’, to create a cheery musical atmosphere while celebrating the patron saint. However, these differed greatly from the festas we know and love today. Back then the ‘festa’ was a time when the poor man got to eat like the rich man, all in the name of the patron saint. With the ongoing years, and the decline of poverty in the Maltese islands, the ‘festa’ started to take on another hue. Although food is still quite present during festa time, and there is still some food which is associated typically with the festa, it has now taken a back-seat, and made way to a more lavish festivity. Make sure to enjoy some typical festa food while you’re there – a nougat bar will be a sure-fire hit (and makes for a great souvenir!). Each festa also has its own peculiarities. In Birzebbuga, a seaside village, the statue of the patron saint St. Peter arrives by boat. In St. Julian's and Msida, a greased pole contest entertains spectators. The mast-size slippery pole extends horizontally over the water from a barge and competitors take turns sliding to the end to retrieve a flag, with predictable hilarious results.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1051" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/st_mary_feast_2.jpg" alt="St_Mary_Feast_2.JPG" width="4256" height="2832" />

The main festa festivities take place inside the strikingly decorated churches, dressed to the nines in red damask and gold under-tones. The solemn Mass is consecrated on the Sunday of the festa week, in a service which usually takes place during the late afternoon. Then the procession commences, during which local men haul the patron saint’s statue on their shoulders, and walk through the streets of the town or village, in a sacred commemoration and adoration of the saint it represents. This is all accompanied by an array of clergymen, altar boys and finally by the parish priest. During the procession, the marching band plays holy hymns, as well as one or two hymns dedicated to the patron saint they’re celebrating. The procession generally ends when the statue-carriers arrive at the church parvis, and with a traditional run, carry the statue up the stairs and back into the church. The Maltese still very much cherish this aspect of the festa, although most use it as an excuse to show off their new outfit! However, this solemn part of the festivities still remains at the heart of each festa, even though some other aspects of the festa seem to throw all religious meaning out the door.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1053" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/marsa-marc3.jpg" alt="marsa marc3.jpg" width="960" height="643" />

In stark contrast with the solemnity and sombreness of the religious procession Sunday evening, the usual Sunday morning festivities are characterised by noise, drunkenness and revelry. The ‘marċ’ of Sunday morning is what usually comes in mind when one thinks of a Maltese festa – paper confetti streaming the air, the marching band hollering traditional and local anthems (most of which are clamorous attacks on the rival band club), and oodles of beer! Most towns or villages have at least two band clubs, who, in typical Maltese partisan fashion, are pitted against one another. This results in a mock rivalry that usually ends as soon as the festa week is over. However, it does give the revellers someone or something to insult during the drunken debauchery of Sunday morning. One of the most notorious localities to still have this tenacious rivalry amongst its two band clubs is the town of Ħamrun, where the ‘Tal-Miskina’ and ‘Tat-Tamal’ still keep the rivalry very much alive.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1054" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/hamrun_feast_1.jpg" alt="Hamrun_Feast_1.jpg" width="2592" height="3872" />

Nevertheless, the Sunday morning festivities are truly colourful affairs, full of deafening music and merry people enjoying and celebrating the saint’s day in a truly Mediterranean way. Add a good dose of Maltese summer sunshine to the mix, and you get one of the most unique and characterising aspects of Maltese culture – the Maltese festa. This distinctive feature has helped form the national Maltese character – hard-working people who take their time to commemorate and hold the sacred dear, while also being able to celebrate it in a merry festivity. The festa is an inherent part of our character as Maltese, and year after year, the festas continue to brighten our calendars with their multi-coloured fireworks and their myriad of colours.

            [blog_content] => The ancient people of the Maltese islands had many stories and legends surrounding their history and ancestors. 
		Most of these myths find their foundations in truth and historical facts, although they were then embellished every time they were handed down from generation to generation. Some of these legends are associated with well-known characters in Maltese history, while others are closely knit with popular events of antiquity. There are some characters which pop up in quite a few folktales, and whose adventures differ from one town to the other.

<strong><u>St Paul</u></strong>

St. Paul, who is said to have landed in Malta in the year 60A.D., features in many a legend. One of the many stories surrounding this holy character states that while St Paul and the other members of the crew of the ship were warming themselves by the fire built for them by the Maltese natives, a viper grabbed onto and bit Paul’s hand. The Maltese natives immediately marked Paul as an evil man, who albeit being just saved from the perils of the sea, had to meet his end with a viper’s bite. However, Paul just shook off the (usually) deadly viper and threw it into the flames, carrying on with no apparent injury. The natives, having seen this, were awe-struck, and proclaimed that Paul was a holy man. Legend states that from that day on, all the snakes found in Malta became non-poisonous – something which is true to this day, as no venomous snakes or reptiles are found on the island. A small side note – the above legend has a slightly different ending for many Maltese people, who say that the venom that St Paul removed from the viper was placed in Maltese women’s tongues!

St Paul has a very close connection to Mdina and its neighbouring town of Rabat, where there is a church dedicated to the same saint. This church is said to have been built above the grotto where St Paul lived and prayed in while he was waiting for the ship taking him to Rome to be restored. The Grotto Myth states that the stone, cavernous walls of this grotto had miraculous healing properties, and that no matter how much of it was taken and removed by the devotees visiting the grotto as a memento, it remained unchanged, as if nothing was altered. This Grotto is still a popular spot today, and can be visited through the Church of St Paul in Rabat. The Grotto forms part of a series of many underground catacombs, which stretch underneath Rabat and Mdina. Some of these catacombs, such as those of St Agatha in Rabat, are open to the public and can be visited for a small fee. Another legend based in Mdina, is the legend of St Agatha. In 1551, a group of Turkish invaders launched an attack on Mdina, which at the time was called ‘Citta Notabile’. A nun living in an Mdina nunnery claimed that she saw a vision, where St Agatha instructed her to make a procession around the walls of the city, while holding up a sacred image of the saint. The nun promptly did as she was told, and it is said that the Turks abandoned their attack on the city, and proceeded to raid nearby Gozo instead. We can only imagine how many times poor St Agatha’s name was called out that night – in celebration and in heresy!

<strong><u>Il-Maqluba</u></strong>

Some of the legends created and fabricated by the minds of the uneducated minds of yesteryear were mainly used as explanations of phenomena happening around them. One such phenomenon was the collapsing of a sinkhole in Qrendi, creating a massive crater that the Maltese of the time had no idea how to explain. What was the immense hole in the ground? What made it collapse? And most importantly, how did the chapel of St Matthew remain untarnished, being only metres away from the sinkhole? Old Maltese legend states that the site of ‘Il-Maqluba’, as the sinkhole is called (meaning ‘the upturned’) had been a village in ancient times, a village abounding with evil and sin.  The common belief was that God punished the villagers by wiping their traces off the earth, while leaving a giant crater behind. Both crater and chapel still stand to this day, and can easily be visited while in Qrendi.

<strong><u>Ghosts and Ghouls</u></strong>

Some of the tales of the Maltese are somewhat spookier than others. There are many sayings about the various ghosts that haunt the island, and given the vast history and the countless wars and battles fought on this land, it is to be expected. The main ghost in the Maltese culture is called ‘il-Ħares’, and although there are tales abounding, it was more of a well-known secret than anything else. The predominant Catholic faith did not give lieu to belief in ghosts and spirits, however the Maltese of olden times still kept a strong belief in this ghastly character, and there was many a house which remained empty for years and years, amid rumours of being haunted. One such house can still be seen on the way to Marsaxlokk, a lovely two storey house in the middle of the countryside, still boarded up and empty to this very day. This ‘Ħares’ took different forms, however it was very common in old days to hear a hushed rumour about a Turk ‘Ħares’, who would provide money and gold to the inhabitants of the house, as long as they kept their mouths shut about him. It was said that if the identity of the ‘Ħares’ was discovered, he would not appear again. There are many more legends and stories concerning eerie beings roaming the island, some from the time of the Knights of St John, some about the Turks, the French and even British admirals and soldiers. I’ll let you in on some of these tales, though it is up to you whether to believe them or not!

<em><u>Il-‘ Ħares’ at Fort Ricasoli</u></em>

The Turkish ghost ever present in Maltese tales makes an appearance at Fort Ricasoli, near the Grand Harbour in Valletta. It is said that a worker resting in the Fort was once awakened by this ‘Ħares’, who looked like a Turk. This ghost told the worker about a treasure of golden coins which could be found in the Fort itself. After having been told the location of such treasure, the foolish workman (breaching any unwritten contract with said Turk), rushed off to find his friend to tell him all about the treasure. The two men set off towards the location indicated by the ghost, however when they found the spot, they discovered a heap of coal coins. The ‘Ħares’ is then said to have reappeared during the night, only to beat up the thoughtless workman who had uncovered his secret. The moral behind this ghost story was to never speak of anything the ‘Ħares’ says, which is why all ghost stories in Malta were kept hush.

<em><u>The Headless Bride of Mdina</u></em>

It is said that a heart-broken, headless, ghost bride roams the streets of Mdina at night, warning young men about the sorrows of love. This bride had been promised to marry the love of her life, and had all the preparations for her wedding ready. One night, a lusty Knight captured her and took her against her will. Distraught that her reputation had now been tarnished, she took out her vengeance on him and murdered the brawny Knight. She was sentenced to death by beheading for her (just) crime, although she was granted her final wish of marrying her love before her death. She is said to be still roaming the streets of Mdina after dark, headless but still in her ill-fated wedding dress, a bride that she never truly was, but now always will be.

<em><u>The Blue Lady of Verdala Palace</u></em>

This tale is well-known among the Maltese, and it is wide-spread enough to make the notorious Blue Lady a household name. It is said that the niece of the Grand Master De Rohan had been betrothed to a suitor who she did not fancy, and whom she did not want to marry. He, tired of being ignored and rejected by his future wife, kept her captive in one of the upstairs rooms of the Palace. While trying to escape, she lost her footing, and fell to her death, wearing a blue dress. She is said to still haunt that same room, wearing the same blue dress she wore to her deathbed. One particular incident tells of a guest of the Governor at the time (Verdala Palace used to be the summer residence of the Governor), who slept in her room. He asked the Governor one night who was the lovely lady wearing blue reflecting through the mirror while he dressed, and the servitude replied that they had all seen her. The Blue Lady is one of the most well-known Maltese ghosts, amongst adults and children alike.

The Maltese have always been master storytellers, that’s for sure, from legends about Saints to tales about ghosts – the Maltese have commented on everything and anything. We have always tried to explain the unexplainable, and we have made up some fascinating stories in doing so. The legends now form part of our very being, and share a part of our history, although some are not based on facts. I shall leave it to you to decide whether the ghastly tales of old are true or not, and while you are here, why not try and find out for yourself?

            [blog_content] => Should Jean Parisot de la Vallette awaken from his 500 year old slumber and visit the city he had proudly designed and helped build, (but unfortunately never managed to see), he would surely do a double take and frantically call his architects. The once closed off fortress city now has wide-open gates, which hundreds of people enter daily. Valletta was built as a fortress, but it has become a living work of art, changing with the times and reinventing itself to keep up with the ages. The beauty of it though, is that the new did not eliminate the old; it complements it in a way that makes Valletta a truly unique capital, a city where the Classic walks hand in hand with the Modern.

Built by the Knights of St John from scratch on an untarnished hill, and designed as a defence from future attacks (which thankfully never happened), Valletta was an impenetrable fortress city, with enormous, broad bastions, and an easily-closed off entrance in case of invasion. Today, these bastions still enclose the city, but the once-imposing city gate has been replaced with a cleaner, more modern entrance – comprised of two columns which lead immediately into Republic Street. Entering Valletta is an experience in itself; the awe-inspiring bastions serve as a magnificent backdrop for the hustle and bustle of city life, while crossing the short bridge leading into the heart of the city you will see all kinds of people from all walks of life – hurried office workers, lawyers, shoppers, and tourists, to name but a few. Past the entrance, Valletta opens up into two sides, with two grandiose staircases ascending onto opposite sides of the bastions – one leading to St James Cavalier and the other to St John’s Cavalier and Hastings Gardens.

[caption id="attachment_media-24" align="aligncenter" width="2448"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/img_3437.jpg" alt="IMG_3437.JPG" width="2448" height="3264" /> Parliament Buiding - Renzo Piano's Modernisation of Valletta[/caption]

Going on into Valletta, a colossal structure will tower over you as you cross the first part of Republic Street. The giant construction, seemingly held afloat on top of miniscule steel beams, is part of Italian architect Renzo Piano’s plan for Valletta’s revamp – and the seat of the Maltese Parliament. Piano’s reconstruction of City Gate, and also his construction of the aforementioned staircases were more or less accepted by the Maltese population; however, the Parliament building has been cause of much speculation and heated arguments among the populace, and has even been nicknamed the “cheese-grater”. Nevertheless, Piano was successful in integrating the traditional with the non-conventional, in creating such a modern masterpiece in the heart of a Baroque city such as Valletta. Beholding the edifice at night is another story altogether. As the warm yellow light lights up the façade as well as the adjoining staircases, you can truly comprehend the fluidity of this Capital. Baroque meets modern, 16<sup>th</sup> Century meets 21<sup>st</sup> Century, Maltese meets foreign.

The beautiful face of Valletta had also been damaged, in some cases beyond repair, after the horrific attacks of World War II, during which Malta, and especially Valletta, played a key role. Being the main port in Malta, Valletta’s harbour and its neighbouring towns were constantly bombarded with air-raids, some of which left considerable damage to the stunning architecture found in the area. One such treasure now lost forever, was the Royal Opera House in Valletta. A stately, ornate building, with a slew of Corinthian columns aligning the entrance, the ‘Teatru Rjal’ was a massive structure, capable of seating 1100 persons. A Luftwaffe bombing in 1942 left the theatre in tatters, with nothing else but ruins in its place.  These ruins were to remain so for many decades, prior to Piano’s renovation project. The theatre’s remnants have now been transformed into an open air theatre, known as ‘Pjazza Teatru Rjal’, or Royal Theatre Square. Several concerts, gigs, shows and plays take place in this revived setting – where once again the contemporary plays well with the bygone.

[caption id="attachment_1087" align="aligncenter" width="3321"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1087" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/battery-street-valletta.jpg" alt="Battery Street, Valletta.jpg" width="3321" height="2157" /> Battery Street - Valletta[/caption]

Valletta has now become a shopping mecca. You can find all the best labels and brands a few metres away from each other, making it a must for anyone looking for some retail therapy. The brightly-lit shop windows line the pedestrianized main streets at eye-level; however there is much more to be seen than just what meets the eye. The National Museum of Archaeology is just a few metres down from City Gate, compressed between modern retail outlets. This building had been the Auberge de Province in the time of the Knights, and it is a fine example of Baroque architecture built in 1571. Here you can see the world-renowned ‘Mara l-Ħoxna’ statue (which translates to the Fat Lady), of which many representations were found scattered throughout the various Neolithic Temples in Malta. This statue is thought to have been a symbol for the fertility cult abounding on the island at that time. There are many more curiosities to find out in this Museum, which is worth a visit.

Another masterpiece in Baroque architecture and in the art of the City itself is the Co-Cathedral of St John, situated a few metres down from the Museum of Archaeology then to the right. This striking monument was commissioned in 1572 by the Grand Master La Vallette himself, as a convent church for the Order. This structure holds many treasures in its’ many chapels, the most famous of which being Caravaggio’s painting ‘The Beheading of St John the Baptist’. Mattia Preti had also been commissioned to work on the interior of the Cathedral, mainly in his depictions of the life of St John. The Cathedral ground is a work of art in itself, where hundreds of marble tombs line the floor creating a patchwork of artwork which you can literally step on. Some renovation works were carried out on the Co-Cathedral to preserve its beauty and splendour; however it has retained the same façade it had when it was redesigned in the 17<sup>th</sup> Century to keep up with the Baroque times.

The Grand Master’s Palace further down on Republic Street had been the seat of administration of the Maltese islands since 1571 until Spring 2015, when the Maltese Parliament was moved to the aforementioned building designed by Renzo Piano. Today, the Palace is home to the office of the President of the Republic of Malta. Today it holds many historical relics which can still be viewed. The square in front of this Palace has been renovated recently as well, and is now open and contemporary. Water fountains sprinkle inviting children to play with them, while comfortable, rounded benches entice tired parents and shoppers to take a rest and enjoy the scenario. This modernized square serves as an excellent backdrop for the remarkable Palace, complementing each other in a harmonious way.

One of the most striking things about Valletta is that no matter how many times it is reborn, revamped, refurbished, it always emerges phoenix-like - brilliant and lustrous, better than ever before. The Modern respectfully tips its hat to the revered Baroque style, integrating itself justly without dominating. Art abounds and architecture flourishes. Jean Parisot de la Vallette would breathe a sigh of relief (the Ottomans have not invaded again after all), and roll over to continue his perpetual sleep.

            [blog_content] => Down by the sea shore where the ferry from Sliema berths along the coastline of Valletta, is a very old building, unseen from the road above, but quietly present and sitting right at the water’s edge. The building has existed for many centuries, constructed at the time of the Knights of the Order of St John and for some time it seems it was also used as a theatre. Eventually it seems its rooms were utilised by the British naval services. Having stood abandoned for several years, it was discovered by its current administrators as a ramshackle, dilapidated and derelict edifice, crumbling into oblivion. Yet, they immediately realised it had the potential for radical transformation.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1175 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_019.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_019.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
Visiting it after the property administrators, Shortlets Malta Ltd directors Franco and Ralph, carried out a thorough restoration, makes it hard to believe that this place could have gone unnoticed, even whilst it is discreetly secluded in its seafront location.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_010.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_010.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
The entrance to this house is adjacent to access to the outdoor area belonging to it – a beautiful ample terrace overlooking the sea. The space doubles up as a pool deck next to a fairly sized swimming pool and a Jacuzzi. A handful of deckchairs stand to attention, invitingly hinting at a siesta, a grand table in black is ready for dining, whilst neatly tucked in a corner is all the equipment required for a mini kitchenette, including cooking space and a dishwasher. This avoids outside cooking from spilling over indoors. Everything is shrouded under the veil of the taller buildings on the side of Valletta, with the full view of the Tigne promontory across the waters.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1178 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_018.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_018.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
A bridge was created to link the terrace to the house itself and after crossing over, one enters to find the first room of the house – a long high ceiling dining space which has a well-equipped kitchen in its far end. Upon closer inspection the kitchen with its white and stainless steel finishes, contains all the requisites for any self-respecting culinary expert. Very well laid out, the kitchen in fact enjoys ample space and a great layout as well as its own breakfast island.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1181" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_057.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_057.jpg" width="1000" height="1499" />
The dining room with its very long glass top table and a series of high-backed white leather chairs, has old fashioned arched windows, large and airy, which look immediately onto the water outside. Its colours offset the rustic limestone aged by time and a turquoise hue runs through the room, from the curtains to the sky and sea outside and back to the valiantly painted antique wooden beams.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1182 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_0111.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_011.jpg" width="1000" height="676" />
To the side of this dining room is an entrance into a spacious and open central area which serves as a living room. With its elegant and fine looking chandelier hanging tall and strong above the room, the living room effectively provides a centralised point for all the people within the house.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1184" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_019.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_019.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
Other rooms radiate from it, namely bedrooms, bathrooms and to the side, a wooden staircase that rises up onto a wooden veranda overlooking the sitting area. This veranda leads into other bedrooms created above this Italian styled ‘soppalco’.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1186" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_027.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_027.jpg" width="1000" height="667" />
The property administrators explain how this wooden construction was ingeniously created in order to make full use of the extremely high vaulted ceiling of this room. Great attention was given to making the parquet soundproof in order to avoid the inconvenience of clacking heels resounding through the house.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1189" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_043.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_043.jpg" width="1000" height="667" />

The bedrooms, which are four in total, come with their ensuite bathrooms, some of which have been created out of exquisitely selected spaces. One of the bathrooms had its surprisingly spacious shower cubicle built into the vaults, and a wall covered with beautifully smooth ‘veneziano’ finish. The finish is found in some of the other rooms, and carries the same blue shade that offsets the generally white furniture well.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1191 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta1_040.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta1_040" width="1000" height="667" />

The fact that white has been selected as the base colour, means that all rooms remain fresh and welcoming, whatever other colours in play to boost the décor. Everything had to be carried into the house by hand, all materials and all furnishings, especially in the rooms above the wooden construction. Wood is a key element in this house, so that the original wooden windows were kept intact where possible, or replaced and matched with similarly styled apertures throughout.

The directors, who have had several experiences in the development of other rental properties commented, ‘in our property rental business, budgeting is very important so whenever we invest in new projects we usually have our properties built and finished to specific standard plans including standard finishing and furnishing. Since we rarely deviate from the original plans our projects rarely go out of budget not, and more importantly, do we over-lap our timescales.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1198" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/ralph_valletta2_020.jpg" alt="ralph_valletta2_020.jpg" width="1000" height="668" />
This time round, this property was a new experience for us. To be fair, even before renovation, the house was beautiful, it had a very symmetrical plan and presented itself as a blank canvas, basically a designer’s paradise. Now, becoming emotionally attached to a building is always dangerous when you are budgeting to tight limits but this house was different, all the important lessons we taught ourselves through the years when developing property, namely to stick with the original plan, were somehow ignored. We ended up spending three times more than we originally planned and the house took forever to finish. Every time we visited the house, it seemed to require a bit more attention and a bit more care and we always acquiesced. Luckily, thanks to the skills and hard work of all the people and contractors who worked on this project, all turned out well and the final product is nothing short of extraordinary.’

            [blog_content] => Malta has an extensive history, stretching further back than the ancient pyramids of Egypt, boasting some of the oldest structures in the world. However, although everyone has heard of the pyramids and of Stonehenge, very few people outside of the islands and outside of this field know about our prehistoric heritage. Given that our myriad of temples are some of the best preserved in the whole world, and also that on an area of less than 300km² there are more than 50 of these sites, it is quite bizarre that these sites are still relatively unknown. Thousands of questions still hang in mid-air .. Why were these constructed? Who built them? What kind of technology did these people have? How did they manage to lift the massive menhirs using just manual labour? Why are there so many temple sites on such a small area of land? Why Malta? These are all questions which remain to be answered, and up til now archaeologists and historians could only throw wild guesses as to why and how these were constructed.

During the past few years some other theories have cropped up, hinting that the temple structures might have been used for reasons other than sacred worship of the notorious 'Fat Lady'. In this article we shall explore some of these other alternative approaches, asking questions along the way - questions which might not have an answer yet, but which are compelling in our quest to find out why.


[caption id="attachment_media-4" align="aligncenter" width="2832"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1221" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/hagar_qim_temple_22.jpg" alt="Hagar_Qim_Temple_22.jpg" width="2832" height="4256" /> Hagar Qim Temple, Qrendi[/caption]
<h3 ><em><strong>Observatories</strong></em></h3>
One of the most widely accepted theories regarding the temples (mostly the temples of Hagar Qim and Mnajdra) is that they were constructed with the summer and winter solstices in mind. The south temple of Mnajdra is constructed in a way that on the equinoxes (20th/21st March and 22nd/23rd September) the rising sun aligns with its main axis. During the solstices (21st June and 21st/22nd December) the sun rises in line with the corners of the door jambs, so that only a very narrow beam of light enters the temple. At Hagar Qim on the solstices, sunlight passes through a hole known as the oracle hole onto a chamber on the northern-east side of the temple. Here the sun forms a disc of light onto a stone slab at the entrance to the apse. As the minutes pass the disc becomes a crescent, then elongates into an ellipse, then elongates still further and finally sinks out of sight as though into the ground.

We know all this, yet still we know nothing. Why were the temples constructed with the sun's movements in mind? Why was the moving of the sun relevant for these peoples? Was a ritual held on each equinox and solstice? If yes, honouring what/whom?


[caption id="attachment_media-8" align="aligncenter" width="3872"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1241" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/mnajdra_temple_1.jpg" alt="Mnajdra_Temple_1.jpg" width="3872" height="2592" /> Mnajdra Temples, Qrendi[/caption]
<h3 ><em><strong>Sound Chambers/Sound Healing</strong></em></h3>
As if the incidence of the sun's positioning was not curious enough, another theory regarding the temples fuels more interest and more plausibility that these structures were indeed not used as Temples of worship (as we have hastily superimposed) but that they may have served different and much more intricate purposes. Studies have been carried out regarding the frequencies of the stones used in the Temples as well as the frequency of sound in the Hypogeum, an underground structure of a depth of 11m, and spanning over 500m². This frequency results at 111Hz, which coincidentally is the same frequency found in other sacred sites around the world. When the human brain is exposed to this particular frequency, the prefrontal cortex switches off, deactivating the language centre of the brain. The brain then switches from left to right-sided dominance, the side associated with intuition, creativity, and holistic processing and can induce a state of meditation and trance. It is thought that chanting at this frequency in these sites induced a state of meditative trance, through which emotional and social intelligence was increased.

This still raises some questions - how did this ancient people calculate this frequency? Why did they engage in trance-like activities? Was it to create a social unity? Was it part of a much more complicated ritual we are yet to discover? From where did they get this knowledge? Were they just 'troglodytes' as we imagine them, or were they a much more superior race than ourselves?

<em><strong>The Fertility Goddess</strong></em>
Another much lauded theory is that the Temples were built in honour of the fertility goddess, to honour this deity and to hold sacrifices for better harvests. According to Joseph Campbell, who is regarded by many people in the USA as an authority on all ancient mythologies, the "Goddess" religion was an expression of "that primordial attempt on humanity's part to understand and live in harmony with the beauty and wonder of Creation". This cult is thought to have worshipped the feminine form as a creator of life and as a connection to mother earth. The 'fat lady' figure has been found in various archaeological discoveries around the Mediterranean, with several figurines bearing buxom figures, mostly evidently feminine. This sparked the idea that there could have been a Feminine Deity cult around the Mediterranean, which later on developed into Ashtarte, Aphrodite and Isis. When viewed from above, some of Malta's temple structures also resemble this 'Mara l-Hoxna' figure, with semi-circular enclosing forming a seated fat lady figure.

Could this fertility goddess cult be the answer? Were the 'temples' built in her honour? Was this why they bore the same semi-circular shapes? Was this cult spread throughout the Mediterranean?

This article has not done much in terms of shedding light onto the meaning of these Temples, if they even were temples after all. In reality, a big question mark still hangs on these structures, and since writing had not yet been invented, we have little or no way of knowing this civilization's way of life, their traditions, the reason why they built such imposing and massive structures, structures we are still in awe of today - nearly 7000 years later. The 'mystery' of the Maltese temples is as intriguing as any best-selling crime thriller, yet with the added bonus of having took place in a reality many eons ago.
Our search continues, and we shall continue to uncover all we can about these Herculean structures. Until next time!

            [blog_content] => Set among the sprawling hills of Santa Maria Estate in the exclusive location of Mellieha, this four-bedroom, brand new, contemporary villa is the latest addition to Shortletsmalta’s ever-growing repertoire. Always keen on broadening their horizons and breaking all boundaries of limitation, the directors of Shortletsmalta Ltd embarked on an ambitious project – a goal to create a luxury property in one of Malta’s most opulent neighbourhoods. The goal has been achieved, and Shortletsmalta now proudly present Villa Carob Hill.


[caption id="attachment_media-30" align="aligncenter" width="4072"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1300" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simone_mellieha_033.jpg" alt="simone_mellieha_033.jpg" width="4072" height="2703" /> The breath-taking infinity pool[/caption]
This villa features cutting-edge design, including a mixture of clean, crisp lines, minimalist décor, and prestigious materials, which combine to produce a natural flow between the outdoor and indoor areas of the property. The majestic, flexuous staircase leads to the main door of the property, located on the ground floor. The team have strived to transform the ground floor into a space fit for repose, a true relaxation haven. Large glass doors blur the lines between outside and inside, inviting those indoors to the breath-taking pool deck


[caption id="attachment_media-51" align="aligncenter" width="6016"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1325" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simon_0511.jpg" alt="simon_051.jpg" width="6016" height="4016" /> Infinity pool overlooking Mellieha Valley[/caption]
The pool itself beckons you to take a dip, boasting a Zen-like water feature and awe-inducing infinity edges, making you feel like you are truly on top of the world. The view from the pool and the pool deck is spectacular; the entire valley opens up beneath you, and the twinkling Mediterranean can be seen undulating in the distance. The sun-drenched deck offers al fresco dining facilities, as well as sun loungers which enable you to fully relax with the impressive view of the valley and the sea as your back drop.


[caption id="attachment_media-32" align="aligncenter" width="6016"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simon_0551.jpg" alt="simon_055.jpg" width="6016" height="4016" /> Amazing views from the pool deck[/caption]
The ground floor itself is made up of a large open plan kitchen, dining and living area. These areas combine harmoniously to provide a peaceful ambience; natural colours mimic the agrarian surroundings of the valley, while also providing a calm setting for the eyes. The dining and living areas are in turn divided by the state of the art kitchen, which is equipped with all cutlery and crockery.


[caption id="attachment_media-53" align="aligncenter" width="6016"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1327" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/simon_028.jpg" alt="simon_028.jpg" width="6016" height="4016" /> Dining Area[/caption]
The lower floors house the four bedrooms and adjoining bathrooms, set apart from the rest of the Villa to provide the tranquillity needed for a good night’s rest. Two of the four bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms, both equipped with a full size bath-tub, for maximum added comfort. The bedrooms also enjoy a terrace of their own, equipped with outdoor furniture. These create a personal oasis of serenity, where one can enjoy the fresh air of the morning, or the still, quiet air of the Maltese night. All bedrooms are fully air-conditioned, and free Wifi is offered throughout the property.

            [blog_content] => Malta has become increasingly popular with expats in recent years. A boom in the Gaming Industry as well as various other job opportunities have opened a new road for foreigners living on our island.  The major part of our population speaks fluent English (it is an official language after all), cost of living is achingly cheap when compared to major European cities, and everything is just a stone's throw away. Forget hour-long commutes to work, it takes a full hour to cross the island from North to South. Boasting jewel coloured waters and the cleanest beaches in Europe, Malta scores high points with youngsters looking to make a living while also living the life. So, what does living in Malta entail?
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1344 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/rental.jpg" alt="rental" width="1920" height="1280" />
<strong>Where to live?</strong>
Renting is always the best option when testing the Maltese waters - it gives you time to see if you like this place after all! There are a myriad of rental properties in Malta, most flocked in the Sliema/St Julian's area, where all the buzz/work/play is. Rental properties in this area vary in price - you really do get what you pay for. There are luxury apartments which will set you back a couple of thousand of Euros each month, and there are also smaller, one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments which are more budget-friendly, in the 500-600 Euro a month range. Take note - rental prices generally do not include utilities, thus you have to make sure to take that into consideration before renting. Utilities (water and electricity) are not the cheapest, but with some attention they won't break the bank either. A big plus is that most rental properties come fully furnished, so all you'd have to do is just move in! Rental properties in other areas of the island tend to cost a bit less than their Sliema/St Julian's counterparts, the main reason being that they are essentially more remote and further away from the 'buzz'. These can be a viable option if you're looking to save your pennies, however beware of travelling times/costs, especially during the summer months when all the buses are jam-packed with tourists.

<strong>Healthcare</strong>
Malta is ranked one of the best places for healthcare around the world. Maltese citizens receive free healthcare, yet many will also opt to pay for private healthcare insurance, which offers a wider range of services and quicker appointment times. However healthcare quality, even in public hospitals and clinics is truly excellent. The cost of insurance here in Malta is much less than in the rest of the world, compared to countries such as the US. EU citizens residing in Malta are eligible for free healthcare as long as they have an E121 form, with which they can be issued a Certificate of Entitlement. Foreigners outside the EU would need to pay for private insurance.

<strong>Groceries</strong>
Not the most glamorous of subjects, but vital for everyday life nonetheless. Groceries in Malta will not burn a hole in your metaphorical pocket, however it is best to pick and choose your wares. Each town has multiple small grocery shops from where you can get your daily needs, and fairly recently several big chain supermarkets and food stores have started opening shop here in Malta. Discount supermarkets have made a huge hit with the Maltese, with local grocery shops becoming more of a daily necessities hub. Average prices for groceries are as follows:
Loaf of white bread: €.85
Rice (1kg): €1.10
Dozen eggs: €2.05
Milk (1 litre): €0.90
Chicken breasts (1kg): €7.10
Apples (1 kg): €2.00
Tomatoes (1kg): €1.10
Prices are not too high, yet they're not the lowest either. It's best to plan ahead and set a budget for each month so that your Malta experience does not send you overboard.

Eating out is also not the cheapest, but once again depends on which restaurants you choose. Average prices for Malta are thus:
Meal at a mid-range restaurant: €16.00
Meal at an inexpensive restaurant: €9.00
Fast food meal: €7.00
Coca Cola (500ml): €1.25
Cappuccino: €1.50
Bottle of beer (local): €2.10

            [blog_content] => A pile of pumpkins at the local vegetable vendor? Plastic eyeballs and brains centrally displayed in stationery windows? Children gleefully running around dressed in an assortment of costumes? It’s that time of year again.
Halloween has been quite a recent addition to Maltese culture. Coinciding with the Catholic celebr21845ations, All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day, meant that the pagan celebrations of Halloween were put to the side by the majority, who saw it as a holiday that threatened religious traditions and that celebrated the occult.
However, the last five years have seen a rapid change in perception about the holiday, with most of the population now looking forward to Halloween celebrations every year. Children particularly love it, with activities such as trick-or-treating and costume parties becoming a staple for the month of October. While it is still on the way to becoming as established a holiday as Christmas or Carnival, it is undeniable that a Halloween culture is thriving in Malta. This can be easily seen by the myriad of Halloween-themed events occurring over the next two weeks. If you happen to be visiting Malta around this time, and you are into gory things, or into being spooked, why not consider the following events?
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1407 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/paranormal-1170x395.jpg" alt="paranormal-1170x395.jpg" width="1170" height="395" />
<strong>Paranormal Circus </strong>
<strong>Dates: 14<sup>th</sup> October – 13<sup>th</sup> November</strong>
<strong>Location: Manoel Island, Gzira</strong>
<a href="http://www.paranormalcircus.com/malta">Paranormal Circus</a> promises to combine ‘horror’, ‘sexy’, and ‘crazy’ in their 3-hour horror show. This is the Italian company’s second-time running in Malta, back after last year’s incredible success. The tickets start from 10 euros which makes it quite an affordable horror event to go to. If you get too scared or queasy, you can always run out and calm your nerves by sipping (or chugging) a drink at one of the great bars in the vicinity.
<strong>Popeye Haunted Village Night Event (for Adults) </strong>
<strong>Dates: 28/10/2016 – 1/11/2016</strong>
<strong>Location: Popeye Village</strong>
Popeye’s Village is known as one of the most popular tourist attractions in Malta. Instead of the usual tourists with backpacks, these two weeks will be attracting an assorted crowd of blood-covered zombies and eerie-looking ghosts.
<a href="https://popeyemalta.com/packages-menu/seasonal/halloween.html">Halloween for adults in Popeye Village</a> boasts to be the ‘biggest and scariest Halloween event of the year’. The tickets are slightly pricey at €18, which makes it a more expensive activity than the others suggested here. However, this year’s theme, The Dark Ages, looks promising. Keeping in mind that this is an era known for the widespread famine, plague, torture devices, and witchcraft, it is probably worth the few extra euros to explore such an intriguing theme for Halloween.
<strong><img class=" size-full wp-image-1411 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/221014170052-halloween_header.jpg" alt="221014170052--halloween_header.jpg" width="1553" height="640" /></strong>

<h4 ><strong>Popeye Haunted Village for Kids</strong></h4>
<h4 ><strong>Dates: 28/10 2016 – 4/11/2016</strong></h4>
<strong>Location: Popeye Village </strong>
If you have kids and prefer a toned down version of Halloween that can be enjoyed by your youngsters, drop by <a href="https://popeyemalta.com/booking.html?book=38">Popeye Village during the day</a>. The children get to have a fantastic time participating in activities such as haunted mini golf, Halloween treasure hunts, and visiting Olivia’s haunted house. There are also a number of activities that the adults can enjoy alongside the children, such as Spooky Boogie.
The prices are cheaper than the adult version, with children between 3-12 years of age paying €8.50 and adults paying €10.50, making it an affordable family event. If you are not impressed by the Halloween theme, at least you would have visited one of the most popular tourist attractions on the island.
<strong>Pumpkin Feast </strong>
<strong>Date: 30<sup>th</sup> October</strong>
<strong>Location: Manikata</strong>
If you are not into the horror aspects of Halloween but you would still like to experience the Halloween atmosphere, make your way to the north of Malta to partake in the Pumpkin Feast in the village of Manikata. The Pumpkin Feast brings together a wide range of delectable food items containing pumpkin that range from baked pumpkin pasta and vegetarian curried pumpkin rice, to pumpkin jam filled doughnuts. You also get the opportunity to buy pumpkins and fresh vegetables grown by local farmers. If you have children, they can be kept entertained with trick or treat treasure hunts and bouncy castles while you indulge in pumpkin goodness. There is also a free park-and-ride system, which is fantastic if you are considering renting a car and driving there. Manikata is also close to the picturesque beaches, Golden Bay and Għajn Tuffieħa, so this event can be combined with a walk along the coastline where you can absorb the scenic views.
Halloween in Malta? Definitely Yay.

            [blog_content] => Any Maltese history nut, or really any regular patriot, will be quick to point out Malta’s war-stricken past at most given opportunities. From the famous 1565 Great Siege of Malta, to the island’s assistance during the two World Wars, it is safe to say that our ancestors have witnessed a battle or two.

The next battle on the books, though, is a little less bloody. In fact, it comes in the form of a poker tournament, taking place between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> of November! To be precise, we’re talking about The Battle of Malta, organised by PokerListings – a hold’em tournament that is considered to be one of the most inviting in Europe and that has even has been named by the European Poker Awards as the best tournament in Europe with a buy-in that is less than $2000.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1425 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/14022275_1194831560579941_7373739664471628058_n.jpg" alt="14022275_1194831560579941_7373739664471628058_n.jpg" width="960" height="640" />

In fact, the standard buy-in for The Battle of Malta is in the ballpark of €550, with VIP packages exceeding this number quite a bit.  This can seem pricey, especially if you weren’t planning on entering such a tournament at all. However, this actually considered to be a low price for such a large-scale poker tournament. Plus, should you win, €550 will start to feel like change for the bus fare!

Why is this? Quite simply because the 2016 edition of The Battle of Malta has a whopping €1 million prize pool. However, getting a portion of the money is not going to be easy, because there’s a projected attendance of over 2000 people. In other words, if you are interested in participating, make sure that you have some skills to back your game up before Lady Luck shines down on you.

The Battle of Malta wasn’t always this gargantuan, though it certainly didn’t take a long time for it to become so. The first edition took place in 2012, and had a total of 342 participants – which is still considerably impressive for a debut poker event.

It only took another edition for The Battle of Malta to become fully established as Malta’s biggest poker tournament, and it wasn’t long before the rest of Europe caught on either.

In fact, 2014 saw one of the most notable editions of The Battle of Malta, with a prize pool that exceeded €700,000 and a huge influx of professional poker players. Among all the participants, there were over 30 professionals from all over the world. In 2015, the tournament once again broke its own record of attendance with over 1,800 people, and a prize pool of €875,000.

This brought a new edge to the tournament, as The Battle of Malta was always intended to be a people’s tournament – something that any casual poker enthusiast could take part in, and indeed it still is. The fact that you could be rubbing shoulders with some of the biggest shoulders in the game, though, perhaps even beating them if you’re good enough, is quite exhilarating!

So let’s take the discussion to 2016. What can poker fans expect during this year’s edition of The Battle of Malta?  Essentially, an edition that keeps to the tradition of escalating further with every passing year. This will be the first year that The Battle of Malta has a €1,000,000 prize pool, and you can bet that the top 3 players of this year will each win a very, very generous chunk of that pool. In fact, it’s safe to say that they’ll win over €100,000 each.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/giphy.gif" alt="giphy.gif" width="480" height="266" />

You can also expect some really interesting side games in addition to the main event, such as the PLO Knights Crusader, BOM Crazy Pineapple, and the Siege of Malta Second Chance.

Like in previous editions, The Battle of Malta 2016 will be taking place at the Portomaso Casino, which is in St Julian’s. The PokerListings’ site still gives you the option of booking a seat, so if you’re up for the challenge, make sure to book as soon as you can!

Of course, there is the possibility that you might end up disappointed, especially if you only heard about the event through us and don’t quite manage to book your place on time. No worries! If you’re craving some casino action, you can do just that at one of the many casinos that are located in Malta, such as the Dragonara Casino, which is also in St Julian’s, and the Oracle Casino in St Paul’s Bay.

If you’re really a diehard poker fan, you might even want to wait for next year’s edition of The Battle of Malta! Why not? Every year has proven itself to be substantially better than the last, and we have no reason to believe that 2017 will be any different!

            [blog_content] => With the Malta Book Festival just around the corner, it’s delightfully easy to get into the spirit of reading. Any bookworm who happens to be in Malta really must take the opportunity to check out the literary genius of a few of our own authors!
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1433 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bookgif.gif" alt="bookgif" width="500" height="281" />
Of course, attempting to tap into our literary culture might be problematic for two main reasons, the first being that if you have no idea of who some of Malta’s most celebrated authors are, you run the risk of missing out on the really good stuff. The other reason is that it’s actually not too easy to come across a Maltese book written in English! Understandably, most of the time Maltese authors choose to stick to their mother tongue.

Don’t give up yet, though! You won’t need to learn Maltese to get an idea of what our literature is like. Because English too is an official language of Malta, there are quite a few gems around. Here is a list of five of our favourite Maltese books in English that you can ask about at the Malta Book Festival, or at your nearest book shop. This list is by no means exclusive, so keep digging for more great titles!
<strong><em>The Secret Life of Nanna Ġenoveffa </em>– Trevor Żahra</strong>

If you ask a random Maltese person who the first Maltese author they can think of is, there’s an extremely high chance that the answer will be Trevor Żahra. With over 130 books published, you can’t really blame them, either. Żahra has written everything under the sun from children’s books to saucier adult novels, and <em>The Secret Life of Nanna Ġenoveffa</em> definitely falls under the latter category.
Though a translation from the original Maltese version (<em>Il-Ħajja Sigrieta Tan-Nanna Ġenoveffa</em>), none of the humour and clever use of language is lost in the English version. The story revolves around a manuscript found by the grandson of Nanna (Grandmother) Ġenoveffa – a manuscript that is definitely not for young eyes.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1437" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/booksgif2.gif" alt="booksgif2.gif" width="235" height="317" />
Offering an introspective take on the quiet roles Maltese women were expected to lead just a few generations back, Ġenoveffa’s story is full of hilarious sexual exploits, but the story is balanced out with the right amount of taste and emotive, relatable characters. Żahra’s short novel does what few novels manage to do as exceedingly well, which is tug on your heartstrings while making you chuckle at light-hearted naughtiness.
<strong><em>Two</em> - Teodor Relijc             </strong>
<em>Two</em> is Reljic’s debut novel, but it’s such a good read that you probably wouldn’t have realised unless we told you! The novel is about a family on holiday in Malta. Elizabeth, the mother, falls into a coma with little sign of recovery; the rest of the family is in shock.
As a means of coping, her son William, recalls the stories his mother would tell him when he was younger. When a stranger appears, he is given reason to believe that her stories aren’t just make-believe, and that there is a lot more to his mother than he initially thought.

We won’t give too much away from this captivating story! However, we will say that Reljic has managed to create a work that is emotionally engaging while also making use of Maltese folk traditions in a subtle, subversive way.
<strong>Several works by Francis Ebejer</strong>
We refuse to recommend any one title by Ebejer because the man is one of those iconic Maltese writers that any literature enthusiast needs to explore in more depth. A dramatist as well as a novelist, Ebejer’s works are often tackled more academically by university students.

That doesn’t mean that the casual reader won’t enjoy his writing! However, to appreciate Ebejer fully one does need to appreciate that Ebejer was avant-garde in the context of Maltese writing. Alongside many other techniques, he was known for using absurdity to demolish established social and literary traditions in Malta. Indeed, though his stories are set in the island, Ebejer explores themes that are very much universal.

Some of his English novels include <em>A Wreath of Maltese Innocents</em> (1958), <em>Wild Spell of Summer</em> (1968), <em>In the Eye of the Sun</em> (1969), <em>Come Again in Spring: Requiem for a Malta Fascist</em> (1980), <em>Leap of Malta Dolphins </em>(1982), and <em>The Malta Baron and I Lucian</em> (2002 – published posthumously).
<strong><em>What Happens in Brussels Stays in Brussels</em> - Guze Stagno
</strong>
One of Malta’s more prolific writers in recent years, Stagno is no stranger to controversy as a result of him not being afraid to speak his mind in writing. In other words, don’t expect safe, clean storytelling here!
An effortless read, Stagno’s novel is a must-read because it manages to fuse a great plot with relevant social commentary. Essentially, the novel can be seen as a take on all kinds of Maltese stereotypes, and how they are accentuated when taken out of the homeland. All in all, <em>What happens in Brussels Stays in Brussels </em>is a great way of getting to know the Maltese way of doing things in a brutally honest way.

<strong><em>Barefoot in the Saltpans</em> – Daniel Massa</strong>
This recommendation is for the poetry fans! Daniel Massa is a highly celebrated Maltese poet for his writings in Maltese as well as in English. His latest collection, <em>Barefoot in the Saltpans</em>, simply validates that celebration further.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1439" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/booksgif3.gif" alt="booksgif3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
The poems here are centred around seascapes, and the visceral, raw responses that are generated from being caught in the midst of such physical grandeur.

The Malta Book Festival has become a yearly appointment, with every year bringing a bigger crowd, and a better, more varied programme. Here are 6 reasons why you should be navigating the labyrinthine streets of Valletta down to the Mediterranean Conference Centre from the 9<sup>th</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> of November:

<ol >
	<li>Not a book fair</li>
</ol>
Don’t get me wrong. Book fairs are great – you get to walk around and buy a pile of books for less money than you would normally pay. But the Malta National Book Festival is more than that. While it did start off as a book fair, in 2013 it underwent a rebranding from the concept of a commercial book fair, to a National Book Festival. There is still a commercial aspect to it, as you can obviously still go and buy books at bargain prices. However, adding to that commercial element is a programme nuanced with educational and cultural activities, making it a far more interesting visit than your typical book fair. The programme is varied enough to be enjoyed by both the very young and old, with children’s activities such as tracing and colouring activities of their favourite characters occurring alongside more adult activities such as exhibitions and conferences.

<ol  start="2">
	<li>Putting Faces to Names (or Names to Faces)</li>
</ol>
The National Book Festival has always been known to gather a diverse number of authors under one roof, intent on promoting their works of art. This year will be no different, with local, eminent authors such as Maria Grech Ganado, whose name is emblazoned on every local student’s list of books to read, having a whole evening dedicated to her and her life’s work. There are also a number of well-known foreign authors that will be participating in this year’s festival, such as the British writer Patrick McGuinness, the Bulgarian satirical writer Alek Popov, and the Egyptian novelist Basma Abdel Aziz. These three brilliant authors will be present at various stages of the festival, with the highlight being their participation in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1755171114748146/">conference on Literature and Totalitarianism</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1755171114748146/">,</a> that will be occurring on Wednesday evening. The conference, along with other similar events, should be a great opportunity for the public to engage in discussions with some of the greatest literary minds of the contemporary age.

<ol  start="3">
	<li>Foreign Literature</li>
</ol>
While you would associate the National book Festival, with national literature, the Malta Book Festival also offers an insight into foreign literature and authors. Of particular note this year is a presentation titled ‘Cervantes and Don Quixote in Literature and Culture’, which commemorates the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the writer’s death. Interestingly, there will be some Maltese elements added to the mix with Emmanuel Abela, a popular folk singer, singing excerpts from the Maltese translation of Cervantes’s work.

<ol  start="4">
	<li>Bookbinding Exhibition</li>
</ol>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1445 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/book1.jpg" alt="book1" width="800" height="534" />
Let’s face it, how many times have you stopped and thought about the binding process of a book? Probably never. Which is why you need to visit this year’s thematic exhibition on the fascinating subject of book-binding. The exhibition, that will be located within the Perello Suite of the Mediterranean Conference Centre, contains displays of handmade books as well as the opportunity to engage in discussions and workshops on the construction of a codex.

<ol  start="5">
	<li>Films, not just books</li>
</ol>
If you are someone who is perhaps more into films than books, you are in luck. Saturday evening will feature a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1786010594974873/">short film premiere</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1786010594974873/">,</a> featuring the short story adaptation titled ‘Il-Komplici’ from the collection of short stories ‘lura d-dar u grajjiet ohra li ma grawx’ by Walid Nabhan. The event is open to all, and it presents the opportunity to meet Ryan Gatt who is the young film director, as well as the writer who authored the collection of stories. The event certainly promises an interesting and provoking discussion on literary adaptation into film.

Do you think you will get bored of talks on books and films? Don’t worry, you can tune out the literary talk and use this festival as an opportunity to tour the baroque building where it will be hosted. Built in 1574, during the reign of Grad Master Jean de la Cassiere, the hall measures 155 metres in length and was at the time, one of the largest halls in Europe. It is the former ‘Sacra Infermeria’ of the Knights of St John, which was considered to be one of the best hospitals in Europe, and could accommodate as many as 914 patients in an emergency.
Best of all? The entrance is free of charge. Beware, however, you’ll probably have an empty wallet, a heavy bag of books, and a contented smile by the end of the night.

            [blog_content] => Even if you’re unfamiliar with the Maltese tongue, you may have noticed that some words roll off the tongue in the most delightful way. When this happens, you can bet that those words mean something that is equally delightful. Take ŻiguŻajg, for example. Say it slowly; utter each syllable. Isn’t it a gorgeous word? What on earth could it mean?
The definition is even more wonderful than the word itself! ŻiguŻajg is an International Arts Festival taking place between the 11<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> of November, aimed at children and young adults organised by Fondazzjoni Kreattiva, with the scope of inspiring young minds to fall in love with art of all forms.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1470" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg1.gif" alt="ziguzajg1.gif" width="298" height="167" />
We really do mean all art forms! From theatre productions and film showings, to art exhibitions and poetry readings, and basically anything else you can possibly think of and more, ŻiguŻajg is the perfect space to get your creativity pumping. Quite a few of the shows and exhibitions here are interactive, too, giving children a great opportunity to participate in creative spaces.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1473" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg2.gif" alt="ziguzajg2.gif" width="480" height="362" />
In fact, ŻiguŻajg is such a stellar introduction to the arts that Maltese schools use the festival as an opportunity to take their students out on field trips. Of course, even though the shows here are geared to younger audiences, anyone will be able to appreciate the intellect and effort that goes into making these ideas a very artistic reality.
We’ve hyped you up enough – let’s get into the details so that you and the kids in your life can experience ŻiguŻajg for yourselves! As in previous years, all the events that form part of the festival will be taking place in Valletta, which only further validates its position as the cultural capital of Europe in 2018.
So how do you get your tickets for ŻiguŻajg? There are two ways – the first, and perhaps the easiest, is to get them directly from <a href="http://www.ziguzajg.org">www.ziguzajg.org</a> (note the lack of Maltese letters). The other is to purchase them from the St James Cavalier box office.
Now, it’s important to understand that you won’t be buying a block ticket for the whole festival – you’ll be buying individual tickets for individual events. This isn’t a problem because each ticket costs only a measly €2, meaning that attending ŻiguŻajg is unlikely to put a dent in your wallet. However, it does mean that you really need to do your homework to make sure you’re buying tickets for the shows you truly want to see from all the available ones.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1476" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg3.gif" alt="ziguzajg3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Browsing through all the events might seem very daunting – how do you possibly begin? Luckily, ŻiguŻajg’s website is very comprehensive, and gives you a detailed list of every single show. It even lets you browse by selecting different age categories, including 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, and 13+.
If you still need some help, we’ve gone through the list ourselves and took note some of the shows that we thought would be particularly interesting. That doesn’t mean that these are the only shows worth watching! Actually, that couldn’t be further from the truth, but if we chose every single show we wanted to see this blog post would never end! So without further ado, here are some our ŻiguŻajg choice cuts:
<strong>Discover Valletta</strong>
For anyone unfamiliar with Malta’s capital, <strong>Discover Valletta</strong> is a must. An audio-tour of sorts, presented by leading author Trevor Żahra no less, this is a great way to visit 24 locations around the capital and learn all about them in a colourful and engaging way. No, it’s not just a history lesson – it’s also a great way to experience digital storytelling!
<strong>Stick Stones Broken Bones</strong>
Taking place at San Gorg Preca College, <strong>Stick Stones Broken Bones</strong> is a comedy show consisting of shadow puppets! Aimed at children aged 7 and over, the show has a real surrealist feel amidst the side-stitching humour. You don’t need to take our word for it, either – the show has been performed worldwide to great success!

There will also be accompanying workshops for those who want to further immerse themselves in the spirit of creativity!
<strong>
</strong><strong>Starlet</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1479" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/ziguzajg4.gif" alt="ziguzajg4.gif" width="300" height="225" />
If you don’t understand a lick of Maltese, it’s understandable that you might be worried about adopting a blank face when watching some of the shows at ŻiguŻajg. Though several of the productions are in English, Starlet – which takes place at the City Studio Theatre – eliminates the worry further by being a non-verbal theatre show!
Great for the little ones, Starlet is about two explorers who happen to be both time travellers as well as space explorers. Their rocket malfunctions, leading them to land on the moon. They end up befriending a small star, Starlet, and the rest of the production revolves around the heroic act of trying to get her home.

            [blog_content] => We’ve all been there. We’ve all sat down in front of the cinema screen, or the television, gazed in awe at a particularly breath-taking scene, and made a mental note to visit that idyllic beach, quaint city or historic fort. While making those mental notes, Malta would have probably been far from your mind for places to visit.
But it shouldn’t have been. Disguised as the south of France, Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, and a myriad of other locations, Malta has featured far more than you think in films.  With its blend of a rugged coastline, ancient majestic buildings, and picturesque beaches, it has been a prime location for film makers for decades.
Let’s take a trip down memory lane, and relive some film scenes and their locations.


<h2 >World War Z (2013) , Valletta</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1485 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/worldwarz.jpg" alt="worldwarz.jpg" width="618" height="348" />
World War Z, an American action horror film directed by Marc Foster features a zombie pandemic that Gerry, a retired United Nations investigator is trying to put a stop to.  One of the most vivid scenes of the film is when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpJoMuuE3Eg">Gerry visits Jerusalem</a> and encounters a crowd of people inside the walled city chanting and singing. The noise attracts the walking corpses and they pile themselves on top of each other until they manage to jump over the wall into the crowd.  As the zombies fall over the wall by the dozens, into the midst of the crowd, the panicked crowd starts running down the strangely familiar narrow streets filled with wide shallow steps. It is not Jerusalem, but none other than Malta’s very own capital city, Valletta. Some scenes also feature Fort St Elmo in Valletta, a fort which had a crucial role in the Great Siege of 1565. Valletta is set to be European Capital of Culture in 2018, which means that there currently are <a href="http://valletta2018.org/events/">various cultural events</a> happening in the city, making it a great location to visit (or revisit).


<h2 >By the Sea (2015), Mġarr ix-Xini</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1488 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/mgarrixxini.jpg" alt="mgarrixxini.jpg" width="640" height="350" />
Described as a romantic drama, the film featuring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did not get rave reviews from film critics, who lambasted the film for its narrative shortcomings. What definitely cannot be criticised is their choice of filming location, putting a spotlight on one of the best beaches in Gozo. Mġarr ix-Xini, disguised as the south of France in the film, is truly idyllic, situated in a deep valley and has crystal-clear water. Since it is more difficult to get to than other beaches such as Ramla l-Ħamra, it is usually peaceful, with only a few locals in the area, along with some divers. Now that the weather is cooler, it is ideal to combine the trip to the beach with a walk to Mġarr ix-Xini tower, which is the largest of the coastal watchtowers that the Knights of Malta erected on the island of Gozo.


<h2 >Troy (2004) , Blue Lagoon</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1491 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bluelagoon.jpg" alt="bluelagoon.jpg" width="400" height="271" />
Troy, the epic adventure war film released in 2004 is loosely based on Homer’s Iliad. Also starring Brad Pitt, it was definitely a far more successful film than By The Sea, reaching the top box office hits and was the 8<sup>th</sup> highest-grossing film of 2004.  The set for the city of Troy itself was built at Fort Ricasoli, which was built by the Knights of St John in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. However, some of the most memorable scenes were shot in one of the top tourist spots in Malta : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf5H0l3GMtk">The Blue Lagoon</a>. Situated on the tiny island of Comino, the long and narrow bay is ideal for a number of activities like swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving, and it is only 25 minutes away by boat from Ċirkewwa.


<h2 >Game of Thrones (2011), Azure Window</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1494 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/azurewindow.jpg" alt="azurewindow.jpg" width="650" height="365" />
The first season of the wildly successful HBO series was shot in Malta, with locations ranging from historic buildings such as Fort St Angelo and Fort Ricasoli, to convents and private gardens. A particularly important location for this series was Mdina, with its gated entrance being highly visible during some of the scenes. Lord Peter Baelish’s brothel is also a building that you can find tucked away in a corner while walking the streets of Mdina.
However, the most memorable location of all was the Azure Window in Dwejra, Gozo that featured as a backdrop to the Dothraki Wedding. The setting crimson sun behind the Azure Window as Khal Drogo and Daenerys hold their wedding ceremony is truly impressive, to the point that fans of the series have flocked to the sister island of Malta to use the same backdrop for their wedding photos. If you also want to frame the perfect wedding picture best be swift about it. Experts are saying that it won’t be long before the eroding window collapses. While you’re there, you can make your way to the other side of Dwejra, known as the inland sea. For just 4 euros, you can take a boat ride that passes near the Azure Window, giving you a great view of the majestic formation up close.

            [blog_content] => Now that winter is at our doorstep and the temperatures are getting colder, people tend to turn to alcohol to bring some warmth to their face and hands. If you are in Malta, or planning to get here soon, you might want to stay away from your traditional whiskies and wines, and try something more unique. The following are Maltese liqueurs worth considering:

<h2 >Bajtra Liqueur</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bajtra.jpg" alt="bajtra.jpg" width="600" height="800" />
The bajtra (pronounced ‘baitra’) is the prickly pear, a tree that thrives on the Maltese islands. Prickly pear trees were originally popular because farmers planted them to act as windbreakers and also to bar access from one field to another, serving as a deterrent to most wanderers. However, it also became popular due to the belief that it contains medicinal properties, with prickly pears being used to treat a vast array of ailments, ranging from insect stings to stomach aches. August is usually the harvest season of prickly pears, with locals eating the sweet, refreshing prickly pear fruit by the dozens.
It stands to reason that the abundant prickly pears were put to better use by forming a sweet-tasting liqueur, perfect for an aperitif or an after-dinner drink to round up the day. The Bajtra Liqueur is best served chilled, with no ice added to it.


<h2 >Rummiena Liqueur</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/rummiena.jpg" alt="rummiena.jpg" width="640" height="480" />

The Pomegranate tree (Rummiena) is also found in abundance on the Maltese islands. While it is not indigenous to the island, it was introduced centuries ago and thrived in this climate. Like the prickly pear, the pomegranate has also been considered to contain healing properties. A number of shrines dedicated to Il-Madonna tar-Rummiena (Our Lady of the Pomegranate) reveal another association with this crimson fruit: abundance.
The Maltese liqueur produced from local pomegranate provides all the sweet and tart flavours that make the crimson fruit so unique. Best served chilled, on the rocks, or as a base for any creative cocktails you can come up with. Sit down and get your cogs turning!


<h2 >Ħarruba Liqueur</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/harruba.jpg" alt="harruba.jpg" width="480" height="640" />

The carob tree (il-Ħarruba) has been an integral part of Maltese vegetation for centuries. Due to its ability to survive on little water and with no cultivation, it is quite a common tree in Malta. The fruit’s beans and pods have had a variety of uses. During World War II, the beans formed part of the diet of the locals who were slowly starving to death due to a food shortage.  Up until fairly recently, carob beans were crushed and boiled to produce a syrupy liquid, which was then used for sore throats and coughs. The carob pods are still used to this day to make carob sweets (karamelli), by mixing carob pods and honey until caramelised. These small brown squares of healthy goodness are usually available during Good Friday processions, as they are the only sweets allowed during Lent.
The Ħarruba liqueur is only another way of enjoying the sweet taste of carobs. This liqueur can be served chilled, on the rocks, or also neat, and it is best served after a meal, to close on a sweet note.


<h2 >Limunċell</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1514" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/lumija.jpg" alt="lumija.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

The Limunċell is the Maltese version of the popular Italian Limoncello, a liqueur made from local lemons. Its zesty taste is the perfect end to a meal.
If you would like to try something different, and make your own limuncell, drop by The Limestone Heritage, Park and Gardens in Siggiewi. One of their venues is a citrus garden, where guests are allowed to participate in <a href="http://limestoneheritage.com/limoncello-making/">making limuncell</a>. First, the visitors are given a detailed demonstration. Then, fresh lemons are picked from the trees and the zest peeled off. This is then put into jars and immersed in alcohol, ready to be stored for two weeks. The peeled lemons are used to make refreshing lemonade and lemon sorbet, with lemonade and limuncell shots being served to guests during this activity.

All these bottles of liqueur cost less than €20, making it an affordable memento to carry back home with you. Moreover, the sturdy, cleverly designed packaging of most of these liqueurs make them ideal souvenirs for your loved ones back home.

            [blog_content] => Not everyone is in Malta for the same length of time, but whether you’re visiting our little island for a week or three months, it is definitely recommended that you learn at least a smidgen of Maltese to make your holiday more pleasurable.
There are plenty of reasons why taking this route is a good idea. For starters, even though Malta is a bilingual nation and most people here will be able to communicate in English just fine, locals will appreciate your efforts in speaking the mother tongue! We really do think it’s charming when tourists have a go at speaking Maltese, so you might be rewarded with some extra hospitality.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1521" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven1.gif" alt="seven1.gif" width="384" height="270" />
Plus, there’s always the fact that learning a new language is simply a rewarding, enriching experience for its own sake – and if you plan on learning more languages, Maltese is a great option. Sure, we might not have the most widely-spoken language in the world, but it sure makes for a good challenge. Our unique blend of Italian, Arabic, and other influences is not the easiest to get to grips with, mark our words, but that’s what makes it fun!
Of course, if you do use your Maltese skills to practical use, you need to make it very clear that you’re still an apprentice of the tongue. Most people will pick up on this easily, but if your accent is convincing enough, you might that some people will try to carry a whole conversation in Maltese with you!

Still, at least starting the conversation in Maltese is sure to turn some heads, guaranteeing that it will be pretty easy to get the help and/or information you need as you explore the island. So without further ado, here are a few essential phrases that you can use to impress the Maltese, and even your friends back home!
<strong><u>Bonġu/Bonswa </u></strong><u>(Good morning/Good evening)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1523" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven2.gif" alt="seven2.gif" width="450" height="268" />
[Pronounced: bon-joo/bon-sua] When trying to get someone’s attention, nothing works quite as well as a heartfelt greeting. Even if you switch to English right after, a good Bonġu from a non-Maltese native will definitely put a smile on anyone’s face. In other words, you might actually make his morning good!
<strong><u>Kif int?</u></strong><u> (How are you?)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1525" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven3.gif" alt="seven3.gif" width="640" height="446" />
[Pronounced: keef-int?] The same principle as above stands here. Whether you’re looking for guidance, or whether you’re simply trying to have a chat, showing interest in the other person’s well-being goes a long way. Human compassion is a language that transcends words, but hey – it works pretty well in Maltese too.
<strong><u>X’jismek?/ Jiena jisimni… </u></strong><u>(What is your name? /My name is….)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1527" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven4.gif" alt="seven4.gif" width="500" height="282" />
[Pronounced: shyis-mac?/yeena yisimni] You can’t make friends with people if you don’t know their names, right? Going abroad is rewarding for so many reasons, but connecting with new people is definitely one of our favourites. Using these two simple phrases might result in you making some genuine friends you’ll come to regard as irreplaceable.
<strong><u>Kif nista mmur sa…? </u></strong><u>(How can I get to [insert place here]?)</u>
[Pronounced: keef nista immoor sa..?] Malta might be a maze for you, but you can at least show those around you that your grasp on the language is slightly less labyrinthine! We bet that you wouldn’t want to receive directions in Maltese back, though!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1529" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven5.gif" alt="seven5.gif" width="500" height="251" />
Pro tip: If you really want to impress, learn how to use the determiner article <em>il- </em>works in Maltese. If you want to go to any library, you’d say ‘Kif nista mmur sa librerija?’. However, you want to go to a specific one, you’d say ‘kif nista mmur sal-librerija?’. Place names don’t require the article, so you can just say sentences like ‘kif nista mmur sa Ħaġar Qim?’
<strong><u>Jekk jogħġbok/Grazzi</u></strong><u> (Please/Thank you)</u>
[Pronounced: yekk yodgbok/gratsi] We teach children that these are life’s magic words all over the word, and it’s equally true in Malta. Have you ever been to a concert or a similar production featuring a foreign artist, and hearing the performer say thank you in your own language?
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1531" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven6.gif" alt="seven6.gif" width="480" height="360" />
We tend to love it here, so if you make using these two words a habit, you’ll be in everybody’s good books.
<strong><u>Tista terga tirrepeti? </u></strong><u>(Could you repeat?)</u>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1533" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven7.gif" alt="seven7.gif" width="443" height="211" />
[Pronounced: tista terdga tirrepeti?] Here’s a fun one that you’ll definitely need to use at some point, especially if you’re making an extra effort to carry the conversation in Maltese. However, it might come in handy even if the other person is speaking in English with a challenging accent. Don’t worry about asking this question – we won’t bite your head off.
<strong>Inħobbok/Inħobbkom</strong> (I love you [singular] /I love you [plural])
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1535" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/seven8.gif" alt="seven8.gif" width="500" height="366" />
[Pronounced: eenhobbok/eenhobbkom] Whether you’re trying to make your romantic holiday in Malta even more romantic, or whether you’re simply trying to extend some real appreciation to family and Maltese friends, nothing goes down a treat quite like love.
<strong><em>Pronunciation notes: </em></strong>
<em><strong>'dg'</strong> = a hard G sound,  like the 'G' in 'Roger'</em>
<em><strong>'ts'</strong> = a soft Z sound, like the 'z' in 'Pizza'</em>
<em><strong>'x'</strong> in Maltese is equivalent to 'sh'</em>
<em><strong>'h'</strong> in Maltese is equivalent to an 'h' sound like in 'happy'</em>
<em><strong>'gh'</strong> in Maltese is silent, it only lengthens the vowels</em>
<em><strong>'j'</strong> in Maltese is equivalent to 'y'</em>

<h3>Wied iż-Żurrieq</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7djPFDsKn/



Definitely one of the most captivating views on the island, Il-Wied is the epitome of photogeneity. Crystal blue waters and rock formations galore, you won’t need any filters when snapping this fantastic location.

<h3>Mdina</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7JISDhdrf/



The winding narrow streets and Medieval architecture make for some pretty gorgeous pictures, and it seems that the more you explore the meandering streets of our old Capital, the more quaint and scenic they become. Make sure to look out for traditional Maltese doorknobs, which are still abundant on the doors of Mdina.

<h3>Popeye Village, Mellieha</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM6iKxSjWwG/



Built in the 1980s as a film set for the movie starring Robin Williams as the world’s most loved sailor, Popeye Village has been transformed into a park for kids. However, it still remains one of the most charming spots on the island, which just happens to look even better on camera!

<h3>Fomm ir-Rih</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BKYY1Nggn0L/



Off the beaten track, yet never disappoints – Fomm ir-Riħ offers incredible sea and country views, perfect for photography enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With white cliffs plunging dramatically into the ethereal turquoise sea, and a teeny stretch of beach (which is laboriously arduous to get to), you can get different yet brilliant scenarios for your snaps. Once again, no filter needed.

<h3>Mellieha</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM12eWCA_56/



One of Malta’s oldest and most beloved villages, Mellieħa is chock full of Instagrammable locations – from the awe-inspiring Sanctuary to the notorious Għadira Bay, so you can literally have your pick and capture a bit of everything. Make sure to check out the view from the Main Square!

<h3>Marsaxlokk</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BMuVTUXjXPT/



Malta’s most colourful village! Marsaxlokk is a burst of colour which will absolutely liven up your photos, from the multi-coloured Luzzu boats with their traditional blue, yellow, red and white hues, to the brightly pigmented facades which adorn the coastline. No need to fix Saturation levels here!

<h3>Gnejna Bay</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BMyy_6tDyMf/



With views that stretch over to the nearby island of Gozo, warm reddish sand and crystalline blue sea, it is obvious that Ġnejna Bay would be included in this list. Head there when the sun is setting on a clear day to capture splendid sunset snapshots. Make sure that you’re not too distracted by the blazing sun seemingly melt into the Mediterranean, and keep your camera/phone handy!

<h3>Jerma Palace Hotel Ruins, Marsascala</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BE5UObKvPO_/



Despite being a derelict hotel, left to ruin at the mercy of the elements, this structure has become a graffiti paradise, boasting some of Malta’s best street art. It is not a typical touristy location, and it is currently still in ruins, yet a walk around the Jerma Palace area in Marsascala can uncover some very photogenic aspects of Malta which are uncommon. Best for urban photographers who love their share of street art!



https://www.instagram.com/p/BIVGbZtBHGh/

<h3>St Peter’s Pool, Marsaxlokk</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BLQmoadAO2f/



St. Peter’s Pool is one of three creeks found in the Marsaxlokk area, and undoubtedly it has become the most famous of the three. And it is easy to see why. Yellowish white rocks frame the dazzling aquamarine sea, forming a perfect crescent – which in turn forms perfect photographs! Look out for the various names and sayings etched out in the pliable rock for an added oomph to your photos.



https://www.instagram.com/p/BJvK3rKjSvo/
<h3></h3>
<h3>Valletta</h3>


https://www.instagram.com/p/BM6Y4VZg4Xb/



No list can be complete without a mention of our most photogenic location of all, our pride and glory, our capital Valletta. There is literally a photo opportunity around every single corner (you’ll find corners a-plenty in this grid-like city) – from architectural features to impressive seaviews, quaint shops to quirky people – Valletta is a pivot of all things Maltese, and a strikingly beautiful one too. Take a stroll around its streets and snap away, you’ll find inspiration oozing out of every stone.

            [blog_content] => 21<sup>st</sup> December marks the official shift to winter, and although we’re still more or less a month away from that date, it’s important to know what to expect if you’ll be spending at least some of your winter time in Malta.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/winter2.gif" alt="winter2.gif" width="500" height="281" />

We don’t hear much about Maltese winter, do we? All the magazines and blogs seem to advertise our unmatchable summers. It seems that our little island has taken the title of ‘sunny Malta’ for so long that visiting the island in any other kind of weather can be a bit of a let-down for some. However, the truth is that winter in Malta has its charm too, although it might not be obvious from the start if you were expecting summer vibes in December and January.

Plus, in the end, it kind of depends on what your definition of a charming winter is. If you’re dead set on getting metaphorically lost in mountains and mountains of snow during the winter time, you should probably pick another season to visit the island, where you can get acquainted with the typical ‘sunny Malta’.
For those of you ready to take the road less travelled and opt to experience winter in Malta, here’s a small list of what to expect.
<strong>How cold does it get?</strong>
Winter here can be fun for people who like guessing games. Malta’s weather tends to be pretty unpredictable as soon as summer says its final goodbyes and Autumn starts creeping in. Once winter arrives, the unpredictability continues.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1573" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/winter3.gif" alt="winter3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
The fact of the matter is that as far as coldness goes, Maltese winters are really mild, on the whole. There’s often quite a bit of sunniness to go around, and wearing short sleeves at the Christmas lunch table is not uncommon at all.
Don’t be too quick to only pack t-shirts, though, as it can also get really cold here, especially at night. Granted, it might not get as cold as it does in other parts of the world (no snow means we don’t really get to sub-zero temperatures), but you’ll usually be grateful you remembered to bring a jacket! Plus, we can get some pretty heavy winds here, which you’ll definitely need some armour for.
<strong>What is the rain like in winter?</strong>
Don’t expect it to rain every day in Malta, but when it does rain it tends to pour. The general pattern is one or two weeks of no rain, followed by a pretty heavy outpouring that can last the whole day (if not two days).
The reality is that sometimes the rain here seems worse than it actually is. Why? For two main reasons:

<strong>1) Flooding:</strong> In Malta, you don’t need to worry about water rising to the top floor of your home, but quite a few areas in Malta are prone to flooding, such as Msida and Birkirkara. It’s recommended that you avoid these areas, and similar areas, during heavy rains as much as possible. Although it’s unlikely that floods will reach dangerous levels, it’s best to always be cautious.
<strong>2) Traffic jams: </strong>For inexplicable reasons, the traffic situation in Malta tends to worsen as soon as rain occurs. To be fair, we reckon that fears of flooding might have something to do with it, but you will notice this to be case even during light drizzles. If you find yourself caught in traffic while exploring the island, have some patience. All the places you wanted to go to in Malta are still worth going to!

<strong>Is there anything you can’t do during winter here?</strong>
Our honest answer is no. Sure, when the weather is bad, you’ll want to stay away from cliffy areas, and maybe be more cautious overall. However, because such weather doesn’t happen too often here, you can usually do anything you would otherwise do in the warmer months. We do mean anything – plenty of people have been known to sneak off to the beach, too!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1575" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/winter4.gif" alt="winter4.gif" width="322" height="144" />
Plus, because children have school and the parents take less time off, Malta will be less crowded than it usually is in summer. The ungodly morning traffic usually subsides by 9 am, and then exploring the island is a real breeze!

<strong>To summarise
</strong>
There’s no other way to say it: Maltese winters are great! Sure, it can get cold, and you might be subjected to some heavy rain every few weeks. That’s no different to most areas around the world, and if you’re disappointed about those prospects, you might be looking at the wrong continent to spend your winter months!

Malta is a great choice for a winter holiday, though, because it is a lot milder than a lot of other countries, and as a result you are still likely to enjoy some warmth here. The rain isn’t too frequent, and the cold is usually very bearable.
We encourage you to pack for all types of weather. Have some t-shirts handy alongside your jackets, pullovers, and scarves, and you’ll be completely set to enjoy your winter holiday here!

            [blog_content] => It’s often said that Malta is a small island with an incredibly rich history. No matter how many times it’s repeated, it doesn’t get any less true. Our archipelago is a goldmine for any history nut, but we encourage anybody visiting the islands to get a good whiff of our past.
Sure, there are plenty of reasons to visit Malta and Gozo – but if you really want to get to know what we’re all about and why we are the way we are, a trip to some of our museums is definitely in order (we promise you’ll still have time to check out our beaches and shopping malls).
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1581 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/museum1.gif" alt="museum1.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Of course, a lot of history means a lot of museums, so the question becomes where to even begin. That’s where we come in! We’ve put together a list of a few of our favourite museums – and because we know that in no way does this cover them all, we guarantee that we’ll have similar blog posts with even more museums you’ll also want to visit in the future.

In the meantime, check out our current museum recommendations, listed below. If you’re feeling adventurous enough, you can even make a day tour of them! It wouldn’t even be a terribly taxing tour either, as the five museums we’ve mentioned today are only located in three different cities: Birgu, Valletta, and Imdina.

<strong>Malta Maritime Museum
</strong>You’d better get your sea legs moving for this one! As an island strategically positioned between Sicily and Africa, Malta has had an incredibly important maritime role in the Mediterranean spanning over 7000 years, all of which is documented in this Museum in Birgu.
The Malta Maritime Museum is located within the Old Naval Bakery, which couldn’t be more apt and adds to the charm of the place even more. Of course, it’s not the outside that’s most striking but the 20,000+ artefacts within. Among these are the largest ship model owned by the Order of St John, the oldest roman anchor in the world, a working steam engine from the 1950s, and much, much more!

<strong>Malta at War Museum</strong>
Also located in Birgu is the Malta at War Museum, which is a testament to the role Malta took up during WW2, particularly during the years 1940-1943 (which have collectively become known as the Malta Blitz).
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1583" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/museum2.gif" alt="museum2.gif" width="800" height="642" />
Located in an army barracks from the 18<sup>th</sup> century used during the war, the museum offers a mix of official artefacts and personal items from people fighting or affected by war somehow, making it a sobering but intriguing look at the largescale terror of WW2.
<strong>National War Museum</strong>
For the bloodthirsty (or, well, people who happen to be interested in wars), The National War Museum is another great option, but this time you’ll have to travel to Valletta, which is luckily the easiest thing to do in Malta ever.
Though the museum covers all eras of Malta’s war-stricken past, if you’re specifically interested in the World Wars you’ll find much pleasure in the two halls dedicated to just these times, which even hosts the George Cross bestowed to Malta (and interestingly enough, a jeep belonging to Roosevelt).
<strong>National Museum of Archaeology </strong>
If you’re still in Valletta and your craving for museums isn’t completely satisfied, the National Museum of Archaeology is the next place to check out (mind you, there are a lot of museums in Valletta worth visiting).
This museum covers archaeological artefacts from the Neolithic period (5000 BC) to Phoenician times (400 BC). It’s a wonderful insight to how some of our earliest island dwellers communicated through art and sculpture.

The museum hosts some of our most iconic items from megalithic times, including Hypogeum’s Sleeping Lady statue.

<strong>Wignacourt Museum</strong>
The Wignacourt Museum is located in Imdina and is named after one of the Grand Masters in Malta, Alof de Wignacourt. This isn’t surprising considering the building used to be the baroque residence of the chaplains of the Knights of St John.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1585" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/museum3.gif" alt="museum3.gif" width="672" height="420" />
The museum is not merely a historical exhibit of the Knights of St John though (although we wouldn’t complain if it were). Rather there’s a vast array of artefacts here, including a replica of the Hold Shroud of Turin, an altar used to celebrate mass during the time of the Knights, various coins and rare prints, and artworks by Antoine Favray, Mattia Preti, and several others.

            [blog_content] => If you had to ask us, we’d tell you that Malta’s living costs are generally pretty reasonable. We won’t make the argument that Malta is the cheapest country to live in or even have a holiday in, but we do firmly believe that it’s very possible to budget yourself when coming here, resulting in a stay that is not only really exciting but relatively easy on the wallet.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1591" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cheap1.gif" alt="cheap1.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Now, we do understand that when you’re in a new country, particularly if it’s for leisure purposes, you might be inclined to spend and splurge. Believe us, we’ve been there! Still, you might wake up one day wanting to give your credit card a bit of rest while in Malta. If that’s ever the case, you can consult this article as a means of getting the most out of the islands while putting in as little cash as possible.
Besides, we really do believe that some of the best things in Malta will cost you next to nothing. Budgeting your days doesn’t necessarily mean compromising them. If nothing else, let this be an exercise in truly understanding that the greatest things in life really do transcend money.
<strong>Transport </strong>
As a visitor in Malta, you’ll either be renting a car or, much more likely, making use of public transport. Buses in Malta are quite well priced in comparison to what you’d find in several other countries. Of course, everywhere in Malta is pretty close, so there’s no way we could justify something like a €10 single journey train ticket. In fact, the standard bus rate here is €2 for a total use of two hours, meaning that you can use your bus ticket more than once.
That’s what we’d call a reasonable price, but of course if you travel constantly the bus fare might start looking a bit unfair. That’s why it’s worth the minor investment it takes to get a bus card suited to your needs. There are three cards mainly targeted to non-citizens, and these are the Explore Card for Adults, the Explore Card for Children, and the 12 Single Day Journeys Card.
The first two cost €21 and €15 respectively, and provide unlimited use for a whole week. The last card, which costs €15, is great if you’re not going to be using the bus too much and if you’re going to stay for longer than a week, but for the slight price difference we highly recommend going for the Explore Card option in most situations.
<strong>Food </strong>
It doesn’t take much to feast like a king in Malta. There are plenty of really fancy restaurants here you might want to check out at least once, but of course most people don’t have the cash to pay top dollar for food every single day. If you’re looking for great deals on lunch and dinner, prepare to feel like a winner with our suggestions.

If you’ve been in Malta even for the grand total of half an hour, it’s inevitable that the word <em>pastizzi</em> will have been mentioned in your presence. If you somehow do not already know what these are, they are possibly Malta’s most iconic food. They also happen to be dirt cheap (but taste much, much better than dirt). A savoury pastry usually either consisting of ricotta cheese or peas, the average one will run you around 40c. Don’t go crazy with these, despite the price, as they’re not exactly the healthiest thing around. They’re sure to make you lick your lips, though.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1593" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cheap2.gif" alt="cheap2.gif" width="283" height="229" />
If you’re also craving the most inexpensive desert you can find, nothing will beat a couple of <em>imqaret</em> from an outdoors stall. You can find these here and there, but the most famous is easily the Dates Kiosk in Valletta. The name is more than apt, as <em>imqaret</em> are fried pastries with a filling made from dates. Just like the <em>pastizzi</em> mentioned above, you can get full on <em>imqaret</em> with spare change.
Another alternative for Maltese cuisine is heading to a baker’s shop to buy a piping hot <em><u>ftira</u></em>, which is an iconic kind of bread made here. This might be a slightly pricier option, but only if you choose to buy other items to make a sandwich. Fresh <em>ftajjar</em> (the plura of <em>ftira</em>) smell so good you might end up eating them as soon as you buy them! Why not get one in the morning for an extremely filling breakfast?
Of course, you will want to wash that delicious food down with a drink. No trip to Malta is complete without tasting a couple of our local beers, which easily hold their own against plenty of foreign beers. We dare you to try a Cisk beer and disagree – it’s just not possible. The really good news? The average price for a local beer is €1.50. If you find the right supermarket, you might even get the whole pint for that price.

<strong>The sights</strong>

This is the crux of it all, isn’t it? You really don’t need us to tell you that Malta is gorgeous. The best part about this fact is that experiencing Malta’s beauty is free, once you’re here.
Put down those postcards depicting Maltese sights, and go experience those sights first hand. You can’t call Malta breath-taking if you don’t let it take your breath away.
Take a hike. That’s not an insult – Malta has plenty of wonderful and green walking hiking areas (and we’ll definitely make it a point to talk more about them in the future). Dingli, Chadwick Lakes, and Bidnija are just a few areas where you can stretch your legs and soak in the greenery. Plus, they also make great spots where you can relax and have a picnic.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1594" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cheap3.gif" alt="cheap3.gif" width="320" height="212" />
Though it’s getting somewhat colder, spending time at a beach is always an option here, provided that the weather isn’t rough. You don’t even need to swim either – relaxing on the shore and breathing in that fresh saltwater air while looking at the crystal clear seas and rocky surroundings is more than enough. Ramla l-Ħamra, Riviera, Fekruna, and Golden Bay are just a few places that will make anyone feel at one with nature.

            [blog_content] => It’s official: Christmas is less than a month away. That means that we can we can talk about our favourite holiday without shame; when we want and for how long we want to. Scrooges of Malta, beware!

Joking aside, it’s impossible to not get excited about Christmas and its traditions. Regardless of what the holiday represents to you, we’re sure most of you associate fond memories of love and cheer with this time of the year.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1599" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta1.gif" alt="imbuljuta1.gif" width="610" height="366" />
Malta, of course, celebrates Christmas in its own unique way, and the seasonal Imbuljuta tal-Qastan forms part of these celebrations. Of course, many of you reading this article are probably scratching their heads right now, wondering what it actually is.
Simply put, it is a magical-tasting concoction made out of chestnuts and cocoa, alongside some other ingredients. The combination is heavenly, which is apt considering that it is usually served after Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta2.gif" alt="imbuljuta2.gif" width="900" height="506" />

If you can’t wait till Mass, though, or if you weren’t planning on going at all, here’s a recipe for you to make Imbuljuta tal-Qastan by yourself! No one will blame you for getting a head start – people like the drink so much that they also extend the tradition to New Year’s Eve, after all.
Making Imbuljuta tal-Qastan is, luckily, really easy to make. If you have kids, you could let them help and join in on the fun!
<strong>Recipe</strong>

<ul >
	<li>400g dried chestnuts</li>
	<li>80g dark chocolate</li>
	<li>80g cocoa powder</li>
	<li>Orange rind</li>
	<li>2 tangerine rinds</li>
	<li>4tblsp brown sugar</li>
	<li>2 tblsp ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>1 ½ tblsp mixed spice</li>
</ul>

The most essential part is probably the first step, which is preparing the chestnuts accordingly by soaking them in cold water for two hours. Once this is done, place them in a saucepan with cold water and boil them until they get a little soft.
Don’t boil them for an excessively long time, as they will keep getting tender as the recipe progresses and the last thing you want is for them to get too mushy too soon.
The rest of it is easy – add the rest of the ingredients, stir and make sure everything dissolves and blends into one thick drink. Once it’s ready, pour it into your favourite mug and drink away!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1603" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta3.gif" alt="imbuljuta3.gif" width="250" height="347" />
There’s a lot of flexibility here. Some people can’t live without the dark chocolate, but others prefer to simply use the cocoa powder. You could also experiment with milk chocolate instead. Similarly, the orange and tangerine rinds can be grated or cut into strips, depending on your preference.

Keep in mind to adjust the ratios here depending on how much you plan on making. This recipe should serve a lot of people – 10 is probably too few. So if you’re catering for smaller numbers, calculate what needs to be altered.
That means that how long it takes for the Imbuljuta to be ready also varies. On average, it takes around half an hour for everything to blend together, but you may need more or less time. What’s most essential is that you manage to balance the fine line of being thick but still very drinkable – so keep checking it till you’re happy.
What if you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, and want to make your Imbuljuta tal-Qastan recipe a bit more contemporary? We have a couple of recommendations you could try, including:
<strong>Spice</strong>
The recipe we’ve provided already calls for the addition of some mixed spice, but you can really spice your drink up to give it a fiery twist. The combination of chilli and chocolate is a marvellous one, and we guarantee that bringing that element to your Imbuljuta will change the game completely. After all, you need to bring the heat to battle those cold nights!<strong>

Alcohol</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1606" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/imbuljuta4.gif" alt="imbuljuta4.gif" width="500" height="222" />
This one is for adults only, of course! Chocolate pairs with alcohol excellently, and there’s really no limit to what you can add to the recipe to give it a nice, boozy kick. For something a little less conventional, we suggest a nice coffee liquor, but some whiskey or rum would also work wonders. We would recommend saving the boozy batch for an occasion other than Midnight Mass, though. <strong>

            [blog_content] => If you’re dreaming of a white Christmas, you might initially be disappointed by what Malta has to offer this holiday season. Snow alone doesn’t make a good Christmas, though! In fact, we can say with confidence that Malta’s Christmas is one of the most exciting around. We even have the CNN backing our claims up, as in 2015 the world famous news company rated us one of the 15 most Christmassy places in the world.
In other words, we might be low in snow, but we’re high in Christmas spirit!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1611" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrismassy1.gif" alt="chrismassy1.gif" width="400" height="300" />
Which means that in the spirit of giving, we can’t help but let you in on some of the best places to get your Christmas fix this year. Our list isn’t exhaustive though, because the holiday really is everywhere, from pretty much every Maltese household to the decorated streets outside. Cribs, for example, are basically set up in every nook and cranny.
If you’re a Grinch, you really won’t be able to escape the season in Malta. We bet you’re not, though, so without further ado, here are some places to get your Christmas spirit roaring:
<strong>Għajnsielem</strong>
Għajnsielem is a little rural town in Gozo, which makes it the perfect place to host the annual Bethlehem f’Għajnsielem, which is a life-sized, animated nativity experience. We’re not joking when we say life-sized, either, as the whole event takes place over 20,000sqm of land. Visitors are given a map to find their way around the makeshift Betlehem, and is a look into the birth of Jesus Christ as much as it is a look into the lifestyle of the time.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1613" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrismassy2.gif" alt="chrismassy2.gif" width="480" height="266" />
This year’s edition is running between the 11<sup>th</sup> of December to the 8<sup>th</sup> of January.
<strong>Valletta</strong>

You knew this answer was coming, but of course we had to mention it anyway! Our capital city becomes nothing short of a Christmas Village during the holiday season, with decorations covering every imaginable space. You can even check out an impressive, 35-foot-tall Christmas tree at the Valletta Waterfront.

On that note, the Waterfront is a great place to take your kids during this time of the year as during weekends and public holidays you’ll find a wide array of free children’s entertainment to make their day more joyous.
Of course, there are plenty of activities worth checking out in Valletta – far too many to list in one article. Perhaps the epitome of Christmas spirit is captured no better than in the annual International Christmas Carol Concert, that takes place in St. John’s Co-Cathedral. It’s a stunning display of song and music, and is actually a fund-raiser, so it’s well worth the €15 ticket. Make sure to book this one, as no tickets will be sold at the door!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1615" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/chrismassy3.gif" alt="chrismassy3.gif" width="400" height="275" />
<strong>Mosta</strong>
It might be an unconventional choice, but Mosta seems to be determined to be put on the Christmas map this year with the Jollywood Winter Fair taking place on the 10<sup>th</sup> of December at the QSI International School. The event is free entrance, runs from 12pm to 5pm, and will feature countless stalls with food and trinkets to buy, as well as an ample amount of entertainment options (including pony rides!)
<strong>Imdina

</strong>Imdina is cosy and quaint, so it’s easy to see why the place lends itself to Christmas warmth and cheer. Luckily, you’ll find quite a few activities that makes it even more of Christmassy spot. You’ll find carolling everywhere, and that includes a concert entitled <em>A Prelude to Christmas</em>, happening on the 17<sup>th</sup> of December at St. Paul’s Cathedral. The event is in aid of Dar il-Providenza, and features the Amadeus Christmas Choir. Also guesting will be a selection of the Marsa Scouts Pipes and Drums.
<strong>Popeye Village, Mellieħa</strong>
If you don’t yet know what Popeye Village is, it’s a unique theme park that started life as the film set for the musical production ‘Popeye’ in 1980. Every Christmas, it changes its tune by setting up a wonderful Santa’s Toytown, which is a great way for the kids to see elves making gifts and play games. This year, Santa’s Toytown is open from the 6<sup>th</sup> of December to the 4<sup>th</sup> of January.

In addition to simply visiting Santa’s Toytown, this year you can book a special Christmas package that comes with a ton of other goodies, including a gift for every child, access to a family treasure hunt, animation shows, and even the chance to visit Santa himself at a new house attraction.

            [blog_content] => Not many Maltese people would readily admit that we have too many public holidays, and let’s face it; why would we? Public holidays are great! Our island is home to the most holidays in the European Union, which we’re happy to count as a pretty substantial achievement.
Besides, public holidays aren’t just fun, whimsical days where we get to laze about instead of going to work. On the contrary, most of them represent really meaningful national events. Perhaps this is no better exemplified than on the 13<sup>th</sup> of December, when the Maltese celebrate the day the island officially became a republic.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1623 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/republic1.gif" alt="republic1.gif" width="500" height="281" />
If you’re here on holiday on Republic day, the whole off-day thing will probably be a bit lost on you, since you definitely wouldn’t be working anyway. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t get into the spirit of the holiday. In fact, it gives you even more reason to appreciate the history and implications of the day, since you have no motive to celebrate other than connecting with the rich story of the Maltese islands. That’s why we’re providing some historical content about Republic day for you so that on the 13<sup>th</sup> of December you can jump for joy with the rest of us!

<strong>The history in a nutshell</strong>
You might already know that the majority of Malta’s history involves being ruled by some foreign power, which means that the fact that we were colonised by the British Empire should be even less surprising. The British took over in 1800 after kicking out the French, who occupied the islands for only a couple of years. Although the British initially ruled de facto, meaning that they were not official rulers, they were later elected by the Maltese themselves in 1813 to become the island’s de jure leaders.
It turned out that Malta became a pretty important asset to the British. We became a shipping stop thanks to our strategic position in the Mediterranean, especially when the Suez Canal opened. Our geographic advantage also proved extremely useful in both world wars, as the islands served as fantastic hospital stations while also providing handy routes to access Italian territory.
After World War II, Malta still remained under the British, although discourse soon opened with regard to what course of action should be taken as far as Malta’s status was concerned. There was even an attempt to integrate with Great Britain, although this ultimately was not successful. Finally, in 1964, Malta managed to achieve its independence, and eventually became a republic just ten years later. Sir Anthony Mamo was declared our first President.
Every year, in the spirit of Republic Day, the President of Malta holds an awards ceremony, celebrating individuals who have brought honour to Malta in their own way.
<strong>Independent? Republic? What’s the difference?</strong>
It’s a fair question, especially considering that we celebrate both pretty equally here. The main difference is that when Malta achieved independence, it became part of the Commonwealth, and as such the British monarch remained the ultimate head of state. When Malta became a republic, it was a final change in status, and we officially stopped thinking of Queen Elizabeth as our own queen.
Despite this, British troops remained in Malta until 31<sup>st</sup> March 1979 (Freedom Day), but that’s another public holiday altogether!
<strong>What’s the buzz?</strong>
Naturally, if you want to get into the spirit of Republic day, you’ll be looking for ways to celebrate. There are plenty of activities set up every year, including military parades around Valletta and Marsa, and wreath laying ceremonies at notable, Republic Day-related monuments. You can even catch the annual band concert, which takes place at the Manoel Theatre in Valletta, where you can hear some traditional marching band music.

One thing you definitely won’t want to escape are the vibrant fireworks. Though you can find these all over Malta, your best bet is to view them over the Grand Harbour in Valletta.

            [blog_content] => It doesn’t matter if you’re Maltese, English, Australian, American, Chinese, or from anywhere else in the world. The language of sweets and desserts is one that we all understand! There’s something special about travelling to a new country and finding out (and tasting first hand, of course) which sweets are made there. The same is true (perhaps even truer) when those treats are brought out during Christmas time!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1633" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas2.gif" alt="christmas2.gif" width="282" height="211" />
As we all know, Christmas is just another excuse to indulge in some sugary goods. There are plenty of different treats that we associate with Malta during this time of year, although not all of them are exclusively Christmassy – which is great news in itself because it means you won’t have to wait for months on end to get your hands on some of our most coveted goods.
If you happen to be in Malta during the Christmas season, here are some treats to look out for!
<strong>Qagħaq tal-Għasel</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1636 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas3.jpg" alt="christmas3.jpg" width="428" height="297" />

Known in English as treacle rings, this dessert is so scrumptious that you might consider proposing to your wife by putting one of these rings on her finger instead the usual gold or diamond option.

These special qagħaq are a great choice for those who don’t like their desserts to be saturated with sweetness. Though there is certainly an underlying sweet taste, it’s wonderfully balanced out by the slight bitterness of the treacle and the zesty flavour of the citrus infused into the baking mix.
<strong>Almond Macaroons</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1638 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas4.jpg" alt="christmas4" width="620" height="413" />
If you knew anything about Maltese desserts prior to this article, you’d probably know that it’s very hard for us to keep<em> lewż</em> (almonds) out of our sweet treats. This is especially the case in Easter, where our treats tend to be made up of 95% almonds and almond paste (see: <em>figolli</em> and <em>kwareżimal</em>).
Thanks to our <em>Lewż</em> <em>before Bros</em> mentality, you can still get your almond fix this Christmas thanks to the macaroons that pop up everywhere. Not necessarily an exclusively Maltese treat by any stretch of the imagination – but don’t tell us you’re not grateful that we love them so much.
<strong>Pudina tal-Ħobż</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1640 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas5.jpg" alt="christmas5" width="600" height="399" />

This is our famous bread pudding, a classic choice for everyone from <em>nanniet</em> (grandmothers) to children. If you’re not a fan of raisins and candied fruit, this might take some getting used to, but we’re pretty sure that come to appreciate the taste sooner rather than later!
This is definitely one of the treats that is appreciated all year round – but Christmas is as good a time as any to make a fresh batch! Do note that it’s not the typical Christmas pudding that’s eaten around the world (including Malta!), and not a replacement either!
<strong>Imbuljuta tal-Qastan</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1644 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas6.jpg" alt="christmas6.jpg" width="625" height="384" />

We already spoke quite a bit about this one in a previous blog post, and even included a recipe for it, so head on there if you’re interested in making it! This is a soup/drink hybrid made out of chestnuts, cocoa and chocolate, a well an assortment of other ingredients that contribute to its unique taste.
<strong>Christmas Log</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1647" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/christmas7.gif" alt="christmas7.gif" width="500" height="332" />
It’s not quite Christmas without a Christmas log, and that’s regardless of where you are in the world. So no, this isn’t quite a Maltese treat, but of course we have the Maltese way of preparing it, which isn’t too outlandish. We keep the same chocolatey/biscuit taste, but often tend to add the candied fruit we seem to collectively love so much!

            [blog_content] => Christmas is just around the corner, and you’ve probably guessed by our recent flow of articles that we couldn’t be more excited about it!
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1653 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib1.gif" alt="crib1" width="200" height="286" />
It’s probably very easy to understand our enthusiasm (and if it’s not, we kindly ask you to bear with us for a few more weeks). If you’re in Malta and need to get into the Christmas spirit (or need an excuse to get into it even further) we’ve come up with a little checklist for things to look out for during the Christmas season in Malta. It mostly covers things you’ll find when you’re out and about, as well as things that you can actively look out for!
<strong>Nativity scenes</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1655" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib2.gif" alt="crib2.gif" width="480" height="368" />
Whether you’re religious or not, it really is a wonder how the Maltese seemingly manage to set up nativity scenes in every single available space. These are known as <em>presepji</em> in Maltese (<em>presepju</em> for the singular term), so you’d better get used to the word!
For quite a few of us, decorating <em>presepji</em> is a hobby to be taken religiously (please excuse the pun). Which means that if you look around, you’ll find many intricately detailed ones that will leave you pretty stunned.
You’ll also find that there are plenty of larger <em>presepji</em> set up for public display everywhere, from roundabouts to used car showrooms. You could start a <em>presepju</em> spotting tally with a friend!

<strong>Cribs</strong>
Don’t confuse <em>presepji</em> with cribs (<em>maxturi</em>) in Malta! These are usually more relegated to domestic displays, but you’ll find plenty of them in public spots too. Though you have less going on here than in the full-blown nativity scene, there are lots of differently styled cribs to gaze at, as you’ll find out by looking at 99% of current Maltese shop windows.
<strong>Vetches</strong>
This is a Christmas tradition that we reckon is more Maltese than most. Vetches is known in Maltese as <em>ġulbiena</em>, and refers to a long, thin plant that is grown to decorate cribs and <em>presepji</em>. Traditionally planted on the 7<sup>th</sup> of December, this plant needs to grow in the dark. In just a few weeks, your <em>ġulbiena</em> could be the envy of all!
<strong>Decorations and lighting</strong>
If you’ve ever been to Malta during a village <em>festa</em>, then you know that it doesn’t take much for us to cover entire cities with decorations. It’s a mentality we happily uphold during Christmas. Though we’ve already brushed up on a few of the most Christmassy locations in Malta, it’s very hard to say that there’s any one city that is not Christmassy at all!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1657" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib3.gif" alt="crib3.gif" width="320" height="180" />
Some of the street decorations tend to get pretty unique, too. An example of this is a florescent light decoration that goes up every year in Birkirkara. It spells ‘SMART’, in reference to the Smart Supermarket in that street. The not-so-subtle marketing initiative never fails to crack us up.
Churches around Malta also brighten up during the Christmas season (as you’d expect), and seeing the beautiful light display is always a jolly sight every time.
<strong>Charity collections</strong>
Well, we might take Christmas seriously, but no one can accuse us of being all flash, no substance. We still give importance to charity during the rest of the year, of course, but just like in many other countries, the spirit of Christmas unscrooges us further, and opportunities to give to the needy spring up everywhere.
What’s more is that people will also come up with new ways to raise charity funds. Just recently, for example, a Ronnie James Dio tribute concert was given in aid of cancer patients in Malta.
One of Malta’s most important and well-known charity events that takes place annually is called <em>L-Istrina </em>and is known for raising millions of euros in aid of sufferers of all chronic diseases. This year, the televised event will take place on boxing day, and is sure to raise similar figures to those seen in previous years.
<strong>Christmas markets</strong>
Amidst all the charity, of course, you can still have some money in your pocket to visit a few Christmas markets and stock up on a few trinkets. From decorations to artisan crafts and little gifts, these markets are a great way to remember that one doesn’t need to spend ridiculous amounts of money to indulge a little during Christmas.

Though some Christmas markets have already taken place, you can still visit the Pjazza Tigne Christmas Market in Sliema (7<sup>th</sup>-28<sup>th</sup> December).

<strong>Pantomimes</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1659" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/crib4.gif" alt="crib4.gif" width="314" height="360" />
Malta has a very strong Christmas pantomime culture, and as such every year two main productions are set up by two different theatre companies, the MADC, and Masquerade. These groups are often seen as rivals, but the reality is that you can of course choose to see both pantos if you so wish.
MADC’s pantomime for this year is called <em>Un-Believe It!</em>, and is taking place at the MFCC in Ta’ Qali. It’s got themes of magic and what seem to be quite a few Harry Potter references, so potterheads will love this production for sure.
Masquerade’s panto, taking place at the Manoel Theatre in Valletta is called <em>Puss in Boots</em>. No prizes for guessing the inspiration behind the story! In fact, <em>Puss in Boots</em> promises to be a continuation of Masquerade’s panto tradition of creating cheeky renditions of fairy tales.
Both pantos are running from the 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> of December (respectively) up until the 8<sup>th</sup> of January. They’re a treat for the whole family and we promise you’ll be in stitches – but we do warn you that you might want to acquaint yourself with local political gossip to understand all the references!

            [blog_content] => Music fans in Malta are truly blessed. From alternative rock to EDM, one doesn’t need to venture far to find a thriving scene. Yet not everyone might know that Malta is also home to one of Europe’s most exciting Baroque music festivals. If you’re the kind of person who would rather baroque on than rock on, look no further than our lovely capital city in January 2017.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1677 size-medium" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/baroque1.gif?w=300" alt="Piano playing" width="300" height="225" />
The Valletta International Baroque Music Festival has not been around nearly as long as the music it celebrates, having only debuted in 2013. Despite this, it has quickly risen to fame as one of the festivals to look out for, year after year.
Perhaps it’s not surprising that Valletta is such an appropriate setting for the event, considering that ultimately it was built in the Baroque era by the Knights of St. John. The festival takes place across multiple venues in our capital city, which is great for a couple of reasons. The first is that you get to see and experience more of Valletta, and the second is that every venue is absolutely fitting in setting the mood for each concert.
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1678 size-medium" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/baroque2.gif?w=300" alt="baroque2" width="300" height="300" />
There are far too many of these venues to mention, but the heart of it all is the Manoel Theatre, one of the oldest theatres in Europe which has remained active to this day. As Malta’s National Theatre, there is no doubt that the Manoel Theatre is the perfect place to host the festival. There are several concerts hosted at other wonderful venues too, though, which include St. John’s Co-Cathedral, the Grandmasters’ Palace, and several churches and auberges.
In line with the quality we’ve come to expect from the Valletta International Baroque Music Festival, the programme features a dynamic range of local and international guests, which come in the form of both solo performers and whole orchestras.
We can’t say there’s any one guest we’re most excited about, as the whole programme is promising. However, a few of our anticipated highlights include:

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reiko Ichise</strong>, a Tokyo-born viola da gamba player who has become known as one of the leading musicians in the UK with regard to her instrument of choice</li>
 	<li><strong>The Sixteen</strong>, which is unquestionably one of the world’s greatest ensembles, with an artist residency at Wigmore Hall being only one of the prestigious recognitions awarded to it in the UK</li>
 	<li><strong>Haymarket Opera Company</strong>, which is definitely one of the leading orchestras to keep an eye out for when it comes to 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century material</li>
 	<li><strong>Nicolas Dautricourt</strong>, who is one of France’s finest violinists in the way of chamber music</li>
</ul>
As you might imagine, this does not even begin to cover the complete programme of artists, but luckily you can check that out on the festival’s website, with inclusions of the dates and venues they’ll be performing at. Conduct proper research so that you can choose your favourites!

Unlike many festivals (although you do need to keep in mind that this is not exactly your Primavera or Coachella), you will need to pay every individual performance. Considering that these artists of extremely high calibre, this is not unreasonable. We also reckon that you won’t be able to catch more than a few performances anyway, so this arrangement may suit you far better than having a single block ticket. Students and senior citizens should be aware that special discounted tickets are available.

All in all, the Valletta International Baroque Music Festival is absolutely worth your time, and is the place to be if you happen to be in Malta in the mid-to-end period of January. Though you could expect a great festival any year, this year it happens to coincide with the EU Presidency of 2017, which is bound to mean that no details have gone unnoticed in the mission to further Malta’s status as a beacon of culture.

            [blog_content] => If you’ve been in Malta for more than a week then you’ll have realised by now that it doesn’t take the Maltese much to get celebrating – which means that you can bet that we’re pros when it comes to celebrating something as colossal as New Year’s Eve!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1691 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye2.gif" alt="nye2" width="720" height="480" />

In fact, there are options to suit everybody, no matter their preference. Whether you’re into partying, concerts, or anything else, it’s not too late to find your ideal NYE location. If this is your first time celebrating the foray into a new year in Malta, we definitely recommend going to the national NYE celebrations in our capital city, Valletta!

Taking place between 8.30 pm to 2 am, there’s plenty happening before and after the special midnight mark. That’s exactly what you’d expect from an event collaborated on by two organisations that are outstanding in their own ways: G7 Events and the Valletta 2018 – European Capital of Culture Foundation. These two groups have also teamed up with the Ministry for Tourism, the Valletta Local Council, and even the Ministry of Culture.

Sticking to the traditions set in previous years, the event is taking place in St George’s Square and will also free of charge, meaning that your wallet won’t take a beating from the high spending expectations that often come with the night!

Saving on costs shouldn’t (and thankfully definitely isn’t) the only reason why you should attend. Here is a list of the happenings you can look forward to on the night, although don’t be surprised if even more features are announced in the coming days!

<strong>Music</strong>
<strong> </strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1693" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye3.gif" alt="nye3.gif" width="480" height="256" />

NYE wouldn’t be NYE without good music you can dance to – and if the music is live then it gets even better! The night will feature a roster of some of Malta’s most celebrated artists, including Kevin Borg, Glen Vella, The Crowns, Musique and more.

There will also be DJs, namely Clint Bajada and Pierre Cordina, who will give you the chance to let loose even further.

For a more sophisticated but no less excited segment, you can immerse yourself in the vibes of a symphony of musicians selected from the Orchestra Philharmonic Malta, conducted by Sigmund Mifsud.

<strong>Projections and Fireworks

</strong>The inclusion of fireworks and firecrackers really goes without saying. The Maltese are the kind of people you can expect to set off fireworks in celebration of afternoon tea, so the NYE fireworks display is guaranteed to be huge and stunning.

There will be other visual shows to keep an eye out for, though, including a 3D venture projection made by the MCAST Institute for the Creative Arts that will actually be running from the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December up until the new year. This show will be projected on the façade of the Grandmaster’s Palace.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1694" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye4.gif" alt="nye4.gif" width="500" height="272" />

The star of the show here is definitely going to be G7’s audiovisual countdown, complete with pyrotechnics!

<strong>Comedy</strong>
<strong> </strong>
<strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1696" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/nye5.gif" alt="nye5.gif" width="598" height="673" />

</strong>
Two of Malta’s most popular comedians, Pawlu Borg Bonaci and Gianni Zammit will come together as a duo to help you enter 2017 in stitches! There’s no way we can guess what to expect from the dynamic pair, except that it’s bound to be cheeky! Both people are known for their musical prowess too, so we’re definitely hopeful for a side-splitting musical number.
<strong>

</strong>
All in all, the Valletta NYE celebrations are not the only option this year – far from it – but if you want to do NYE Maltese style on a national level, this is the way to do it. With a combination of all the things we love the most about NYE, including music, fireworks, and comedy, Valletta is going to provide the whole package this year.

Plus, we guarantee that you’re going to meet a massive amount of people!

            [blog_content] => As we wave our final goodbyes to 2016, we’re thankful for all the technological advances made this year – but we’re still terribly miffed that science hasn’t granted us the ability to physically be in multiple places at once.

You see, this is a problem because it means we can only choose one party to go to for New Year’s Eve 2016!

Last week, we wrote about the grand NYE celebrations in Valletta, which is still a fantastic option. For anyone looking for alternative hangouts for the night, though, here’s a list of candidates that could capture your attention. We can’t say we’ve covered every single option (a list that long is one you probably wouldn’t finish reading until 2017), but we have tried to cover a range of options to suit the tastes of as many people as we could!<strong>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/740922012722172/" target="_blank">ALT NYE 2016</a>
</strong><strong>
</strong>You can’t talk about NYE alternatives without mentioning 2016’s biggest alternative scene party! Taking place at The Warehouse Club in Zurrieq, the party is the result of four respected event organisers coming together: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TrackageScheme/">Trackage Scheme</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SickofAnts/">Sick of Ants</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nosweatproductions/">No Sweat Productions</a> amp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hedonevents/">Hedon Crew</a>.
The entertainment will be provided by an eclectic mix of live bands and DJs. The list of bands includes Kill the Action, Beesqueeze, Lucy’s Last, and Bila. If you’re unaware of these bands, they all fall into some category of alternative rock and punk, so you know it’s going to be a pretty loud and raunchy experience!

<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/963278737110021/" target="_blank">MokSHA New Year’s Eve – NYE by Duncan F</a>

Alex Thomson, Twain, Julian Drury, and Tiffany are just a few of the DJs who will be spinning pounding electronic tunes all night.

<strong>NYE at Hugo’s Terrace

            [blog_content] => Though the coming of 2017 marks the dawn of a new year, it also marks the realisation that the for the next few months, we can expect the peak of Malta’s cold weather. Of course, it’s hard to really complain about the cold in Malta, since we don’t reach sub-zero temperatures as other countries do.

It does indeed get chilly – but rather than complain, we should celebrate the weather by enjoying a delicious cup of coffee and tasty treat from one of Malta’s cosiest cafés!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1728" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe1.gif" alt="Cafe1.gif" width="540" height="641" />

For anyone who is a fan of warm drinks and the like, Malta is quite the paradise. Many cafés here understand the art of making a satisfying cup of love – and what could be better than enjoying a cup of love, paired with a toasty snack, in a cosy setting?

Of course, the list of places we’ve included here is by no means intended to denounce the myriad other cafés that can tickle your taste buds just as well!
<strong>Café Jubilee</strong>
Located in both Valletta, Gzira, and Victoria (Gozo), Café Jubilee has become quite the franchise since its beginnings in 1998. Known for its chique décor, there’s a very swing-era feel to this café which is hard not to be enchanted by. Café Jubilee often hosts live acoustic music too, which never fails to add to the ambiance!
We’re also huge fans of the food – there’s everything from delicious sandwiches, pasta, and an array of other options.
<strong>Molly’s Café
</strong>A much more recent venue, Molly’s Café quickly made waves for one particular reason – its pancakes!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe2.gif" alt="Cafe2.gif" width="506" height="358" />
Though Molly’s serves an array of tantalising desserts (and great coffee too, of course), its pancakes soon became the stuff of legend. With staples like Red Velvet pancakes, and seasonal ones like Mince Pie pancakes, it’s not hard to see why! Don’t forget to stop here during your next visit to Mosta!

<strong>Il-Kikkra Café

</strong>Il-Kikkra is an old favourite Valletta stop, and definitely is one of the cafés on this list that does cosiness best. In fact, sitting at Il-Kikkra can be a bit of a tight squeeze, but if you can find a place when it’s not too crowded, the visit will be quite the treat.

Speaking of treats, Il-Kikkra is known for its delicious snacks. Essentially, they’re baked versions of the food you’d find at pastizzi vendors, so you get double the deliciousness and half the guilt. Our favourite offering is the meat pie, by far!
<strong>Café Cordina
</strong>
Café Cordina certainly doesn’t need our endorsement, but we’re recommending them anyway because its service definitely lives up to its fantastic reputation.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe3.gif" alt="Cafe3.gif" width="400" height="300" />

This is another Valletta café, but is undoubtedly one of the most popular around the island! Aside from the obviously great food and coffee, patrons can enjoy live jazz every Thursday at the Piazza Regina.
<strong>Fontanella

</strong>Fontanella is the most well-known café in Imdina, and it’s so easy to see why. There are so many reasons why a trip to Fontanella is a must for anybody in Malta. For starters, you will have an impeccable view of the Maltese islands, if you sit upstairs. It’s a gorgeous sight.

The food menu is also very good, with a great range of sandwiches and pizzas to choose from. However, the crowning jewel of the Fontanella menu is definitely its famous chocolate cake, which is possibly half the reason for the café’s great reputation.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cafe4.gif" alt="Cafe4.gif" width="400" height="300" />

<strong>Talbot amp; Bons

</strong>Talbot amp; Bons is located at the Malta International Airport, making it a worthy consideration as a place to refuel right before or after boarding a flight! That being said, this is definitely a café that commands your attention. It’s stylish and modern, and is full of spectacular boutique products you won’t find anywhere else in Malta, including beer, chocolates, and juices.

            [blog_content] => Malta means many different things to many different people, but it seems to be a collective understanding that above all it is a beautiful place of great historical and cultural value. With all the preparations for 2018, in which Valletta will be the cultural capital of Europe, it’s hard to forget this. Let’s take a step back, though. It’s not 2018 just yet – it’s the very beginning of 2017, so let’s have a look at a few of those pockets of wonder and beauty that have been around for years and years!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums2.gif" alt="museums2.gif" width="499" height="281" />
Those pockets of wonder are often best captured through the myriad Maltese museums that you can visit around the islands. We’ve already done a segment on Maltese museums, highlighting some of the top locations to get your history fix. However, the talent for curation we have here spreads much wider, so here are a few more Malta Museums for your delectation!
<strong>National Museum of Fine Arts
</strong>
Museums aren’t just about history, and yet everything within them is inherently historical (but that’s a discussion best kept for University or Saturdays at 4 a.m.). Perhaps that’s why we have such a deep-rooted love for the National Museum of Fine Arts – it’s such a stunning display of some of finest artworks in Malta, yet those artworks are inevitably a celebration of the historical period they were created in.
In fact, most of the artworks in this Valletta museum were created during the time of the Order of St John. Here you can find works by Valentin de Boulone, Jusepe Ribera, Guido Reni, Albert Bierstadt, Joseph Mallord Wlliam Turner, and others. The centrepiece of the museum perhaps comes in the form of Mattia Preti’s works, and indeed you won’t find a larger collection of his paintings anywhere else in the world.
The building in which the museum is located is also a testament to history in itself, being one of the oldest buildings erected during the time of the Knights and serving multiple purposes during its existence, from a residence to the Order to becoming the Admiralty House for the British during the 1820s.
<em>Please note: The National Museum of Fine Arts closed its doors on the 2nd October 2016, and will be reopening in 2018 as MUZA, the new national community art museum at the Auberge d'Italie in Valletta. More information can be obtained here: <a href="http://heritagemalta.org/national-museum-of-fine-arts-closing-its-doors-at-the-admiralty-house-on-2nd-october/" target="_blank">http://heritagemalta.org/national-museum-of-fine-arts-closing-its-doors-at-the-admiralty-house-on-2nd-october/</a></em>
<strong>The Inquisitor’s Palace</strong>
Another historical-building-turned-museum, the Inquisitor’s Palace is a must visit because there are virtually no such palaces left around the world. Many of these got wiped out during the French Revolution. The Maltese Inquisitor’s Palace in Birgu, thankfully, is still intact.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1746 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums3.gif" alt="museums3" width="400" height="300" />
Sure, the implications of inquisition might be morbid, but they are fascinating nonetheless, and considering that it has been the residence of all inquisitors from 1574 till the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century, much work was done to turn the palace into a gorgeous mansion.
<strong>Domvs Romana</strong>
Though not one of the larger museums in Malta, the Domvs Romana in Rabat certainly provides the most fascinating and rewarding insight into our ties with Roman culture and art.

The Domvs Romana is most highly associated with its mosaic displays, and although these are stunning it also houses various other artefacts. More than just a display of Roman art, the museum provides insight into the lifestyles and roles inhabited by Roman families in Malta.

The museum itself has quite a bit of history, as it too is the aftermath of an ancient aristocratic Roman townhouse found in 1881. Just a year later, the townhouse became a public museum. The museum has been renovated a number of times to preserve its structure and the art within.
<strong>Malta Aviation Museum</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1748 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums4.gif" alt="museums4" width="400" height="275" />

The Malta Aviation Museum is located in Ta Qali, which is the former airfield of the Royal Air Force in Malta, once again making it the most apt place to host its exhibits. The museum is spread over three separate hangars, each of them containing a number of impressive planes used throughout Malta’s aviation history, but of course mostly covering those used in Second World War and Post-war periods.
<strong>Gozo Museum of Archaeology</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/museums5.gif" alt="museums5.gif" width="480" height="275" />
In our last article, we spoke about the National Museum of Archeology in Malta, but to witness the archaeological wonders of Gozo, you’ll have to visit the museum that is set behind the original gateway to the Citadel. Once a 17<sup>th</sup> century townhouse, the Gozo Museum of Archeology now hosts examples of archaeology in three main divisions: prehistory, the classical period, and Medieval/Early Modern periods.

            [blog_content] => One thing that is very well known about Malta is the high regard we hold for the Eurovision, but that doesn’t quite do justice to the quality of music you’ll find here if you dig a little deeper.
Now, we’re not necessarily trying to demonise that festival, but we will say that it’s almost embarrassing how few people in comparison know how great and vibrant Malta’s live music scene is, especially once you start looking into local alternative acts who are bold and experimental in their approach while still being tasteful and catchy.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1756 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bands2.gif" alt="bands2" width="500" height="234" />
It’s really easy to get excited for local music, especially in 2017, when so many stellar acts have promised that an album or other kind of release is in the pipeline. The only pity is that not enough people know about them!
That’s why for this article, we’ve skipped the bubblegum pop and went straight for bands that aren’t necessarily given the right attention by local radio stations! That’s not to say that most of these acts are unknown, as many of them draw pretty astounding numbers in their respective scenes. We will warn you that many of these bands do actually sing in Maltese, but if the language is completely alien to you, that shouldn’t detract from the catchiness!<strong>

Brikkuni</strong>
Take Brikkuni for example, who have filled quite a few theatres since their inception in 2008. This is a band that has received significant media coverage, but usually for controversial reasons. The latest Brikkuni-related fiasco saw the band getting banned from performing at the annual Farson’s Beerfest after the lead singer had some not-very-nice things to say about a certain political figure (and we’ll leave it at that).
In fact, Brikkuni is not a very shy band, and this is one of their selling points. It is the delight of fans at their gigs to sing along to the cheeky, and often vulgar lyrics.
The band’s new album, <em>Rub Al Khali</em>, marks a departure from the brashness, and fans are going to have to adjust. The band have described the new album as a more sombre, sentimental album that is more challenging to the ear. At the time of writing this article, only the album’s title track has been released. You can listen to it here:<strong>
</strong>
https://brikkuni.bandcamp.com/releases
The good news is that the band has promised that this album will be available to download for free off Bandcamp, meaning that the band has taken a different approach to previous releases in almost every single way. Speaking of which, if you want to hear the difference between <em>Rub Al Khali</em> and the older, folksier Brikkuni sound, most of the band’s repertoire is on Youtube:



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yj-7Uilp5o



<strong>Plato’s Dream Machine

</strong>When Plato’s Dream Machine released their debut album in 2014, we’re not sure that anyone could have anticipated the sounds that would be on it. Once a folk act, the debut album <em>Għera</em> marked a complete shift from that genre. Plato’s Dream Machine took on a Radiohead-like approach with introspective lyrics and an unmistakable, unique charm. Check out <em>Flien</em>, from the first album, to see what we mean:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi5lCDaGXuo


For the new album, which has yet to be titled, the band took advantage of crowdfunding platforms, and it paid off. Though no recorded material has been made available yet, the band has already been playing its new songs live, and they sound just as great as those on <em>Għera</em>. They’re even, dare we say, somewhat poppier! <em>Filgħodu </em>is one of the tracks that we’re really excited about hearing in recorded format:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeUv2EThyLk




<strong>Brodu

</strong>Brodu is another band that released its debut album in 2014, and what an album it was. Titled <em>Ħabullabullojb</em> (don’t worry readers, that’s a made-up word and we can’t wrap our tongues around it either), the album was a seamless display of styles and emotions. Though the lyrics are in Maltese, the music will make you bop your head with feel-good emotions, as well as make you cry your heart out.

Knowing the lyrics help, of course, as they are some of the most mature and beautiful that we’ve read in any language. Singer Mark ‘iz-Zizza’ might not be the greatest singer in the world, but he’s easily one of the most charismatic. Take a song like <em>Iċ-Ċimiterju</em>, where in five minutes he convinces you that cemeteries have less to do with death and much more to do with feeling proximity with people who have passed away.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gq6riex2Iw


Brodu also know how to be upbeat. Check out <em>Kemm Jiena Cool!!</em> from the same album, which cheekily makes fun of faux-activists and anyone else too far up their high horse.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszw0FJHNfk



With such a dynamic array of sounds and themes to look forward to, we’re itching to learn more about the 2017 album. Alas, not much has been revealed yet!

<strong>Fuzzhoneys
</strong>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ-7D_Bu2zg

Fuzzhoneys are the first band on this list to sing in English, but that’s far from being the most exciting thing about them. Their dirty, blues-rock sound is bound to appeal to a wide range of people. The band already has a few songs on Youtube and an EP, <em>CD tal-Ġenn</em>, that was released last year, and although those songs really blend bounciness and grit well, we have reason to believe the full-length album is going to be heaps better!
<strong>Beesqueeze</strong>

Beesqueeze are a rather recent project, having risen from the ashes of now-defunct punk outfit Cable35. Beesqueeze shows a more experiment side to the remaining members, and although the live gigs have proven there’s still plenty of penchant for high-octane energy, there are also some mellower, broodier moments, as you’ll find in the band’s debut single from last year:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfRM8BQz-00


For 2017, Beesqueeze have promised an EP rather than a full-length album, but we’ll happily take it!


<strong>The Ranch

</strong>Though The Ranch are often associated with the jazz scene, the truth is you’ll find every kind of sound seamlessly fused into the eclectic palette of The Ranch. The band’s debut album <em>Cuckoo Island</em>, released in 2015, made waves as one the best instrumental albums to ever grace Malta.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u054z61be4


In 2016, The Ranch saw a pretty significant change in line up, and now the band has a new bassist and guitarist - that’s 2/3 of the group! Yet, the new members have proved that they are more than capable of doing justice to the old material. It was a big year for The Ranch in other ways too, as the band recently embarked on an international tour. What we’re really excited about is how The Ranch (2.0) will approach an album with new material! Luckily, we’ll be able to find out in the coming months.

            [blog_content] => A bunch of rocks piled next to each other can often be unimpressive, unless of course they happen to form a megalithic temple.
Our islands are home to a pretty substantial number of prehistoric temples known collectively as the Megalithic Temples of Malta. There are a number of reasons why you should visit at least some of them during your stay in Malta.

First of all, Malta’s history is definitely one of its most fascinating selling points, as we keep mentioning in our blog posts. The downside to this is that it can definitely be overwhelming to inform yourself of every period of Malta’s very densely-packed story. If you’re going to start anywhere, though, you might as well start at what is literally the beginning.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1783 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/megalithic2.gif" alt="megalithic2.gif" width="480" height="270" />
Yet, the Megalithic Temples of Malta are significant for much more than just Malta’s own history. They’re a big deal for the whole world, and we’re not just waving our flag a little too boldly when we say that. UNESCO actually has several of these structures listed as world heritage sites. The fact is that these temples are some of the oldest free-standing structures of Earth. Built between 3600-700 BC, they are quite the shining example of archaeological innovation in prehistorical eras.
It’s not just the stone structures that are fascinating, though impressive they indeed are. It’s what they represent that really speaks to visitors –that in all facets of history the same questions of spirituality are asked, and that cultures inevitably revolve around those questions no matter how ‘evolved’ that culture happens to be. A trip to the Megalithic temples is not likely to offer any real answers, but it is sure to provide a resonance that you might not find in most other places.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1785" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/megalithic3.gif" alt="megalithic3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
If you’re looking for that resonance, or if you simply want to immerse yourself in these important remains from history, visiting the megalithic temples is an easy process. Read on to discover a bit more about some of the most well-known temples in Malta – but of course, we won’t give away all the secrets. You’ll have to unravel more as you explore the sites first-hand.

<strong>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a> Temples</strong>
The first temples on the list are actually located in Gozo - Xagħra, to be precise. If you think that a trip to Gozo just to see these temples might be a waste of your time (a trip to Gozo is never a waste of time, but we digress), let us persuade you otherwise.
In fact, we’d go as far as to say that if you can only make time for one group of temples during your stay in Malta, this should probably be it. These temples are both the oldest and the largest in Malta. In fact, the name ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a>’ actually comes from the word Giant, as it was a Maltese folklore tale that the Megalithic temples were actually built by the giants.
<img class=" size-full wp-image-1787 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/megalithic4.gif" alt="megalithic4.gif" width="250" height="141" />
The two temples that make up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a> have been extremely well preserved, making it really possible to understand the details of the furnishings and structure. From apses to altars, from animal bones to libation holes, there will be no doubt in your mind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A0gantija">Ġgantija</a>’s significance as a place of worship and sacrifice.
<strong>Ħaġar Qim and the Mnajdra Temples</strong>
Located in Qrendi, this is another temple with interesting etymology, as the name more or less translates into ‘Stones of Worship’.
Ħaġar Qim is well-known for its particular structure, involving a central building and two lesser structures. What is most interesting is the use of C-shaped apses that make up the rooms of the temple. However, much intrigue has also been raised due to the discovery of high altar-tables, as well as statuettes of obese figures (often considered to be the Maltese goddess of fertility).

Just 500 metres away are the Mnajdra Temples, which is perhaps best-known for its southern temple which is ingeniously designed to align with the rising run during solstices and equinoxes. In other words, during the summer solstice the first rays of sun light up the megalith between the first apses, while during the winter equinox the same happens to the opposing apse.
<strong>Ta' Ħaġrat and Skorba Temples</strong>
We’re placing these two temples together because there’s only a kilometre between them! That doesn’t mean you should see these as the same structure because they are both beautiful for their own reasons.
Ta’ Ħaġrat temple in Mġarr is made up of two temples, yet is one of the smaller Neolithic structures in Malta. It’s biggest claim to fame is the discovery of beautiful Mġarr phase pottery in the surrounding village.
The Skorba site is perhaps not as preserved as some other structures, but it has been a fascinating source of information nonetheless. What we do know about Skorba is that it was revisited in later eras of prehistory. As a result, one can find both the remnants of the Ġgantija era, namely the three-apsed shape of the Ġgantija phase, as well as later monuments introduced in the Tarxien phase.
<strong>The Tarxien Temples and the Hypogeum </strong>
Both the Tarxien Temples and the Hypogeum were located in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, which is apt considering that there is only around 400 metres between them. Both are impressive sites in their own right, and the Tarxien Temples deserve their due attention for being a shining example of Tarxien phase building, complete with detailed carvings into the walls.
Yet, these temples do tend to get slightly overshadowed by the Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni, and perhaps understandably considering that it is the only known underground prehistoric temple in the world. Entrance to the Hypogeum is somewhat exclusive – anyone can get in, but the site only accepts 80 people a day, so you might need to book your tour well in advance. The experience is well worth it, though.

Consisting of three distinct levels, the Hypogeum is a stunning representation of everything that makes Maltese Megalithic Temples wondrous, from the burial chambers, to the red ochre spiral paintings on the walls.

            [blog_content] => It might seem like an odd thing to say, but pastizzi are one of the cornerstones of Maltese culture. Their aroma scents every other street due to the abundance of pastizzeriji in Malta; they’re eaten at literally every single time of day, from breakfast to dinner to 5 a.m. after wild nights out; and they’re one of the first things that any newcomer to Malta will inevitably hear about.

So sampling a pastizz (or two, or three) is a must when in Malta, and that’s non-negotiable. Sure, these inexpensive, flaky pastries are far from being the healthiest thing around, but that’s why you’ll have to simply consider them as sinful treats and show some self-restraint with them!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1794 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pastizzi2.gif" alt="pastizzi2.gif" width="500" height="330" />
Don’t bite blindly into your first pastizz, though! This article will tell you everything you need to know about this local scrumptious snack.
<strong>There are more flavours now than tradition suggests
</strong><strong>
</strong>Pastizzi are traditionally known for coming in one of two main fillings: pea (pastizzi tal-pizelli) and ricotta cheese (pastizzi tar-rikotta). These have been the two staple pastizzi flavours for years and years, and even now they’re easily the most popular and common variations around.

However, if you’re looking for more adventurous pastizzi, you’re in luck, as quite a few pastizzeriji have decided to introduce some newer variations. Chicken pastizzi are growing in popularity, and if you look hard enough you’ll even find rabbit and peppered steak pastizzi!

The steady rise of Nutella pastizzi has furthermore challenged the idea that pastizzi have to be a savoury treat!
<strong>Pastizzi come in different types</strong>

Pastizzi are most commonly made with philo-pastry, resulting in its iconic flaky texture. If you prefer something a bit less messy, though, you can also find pastizzi made with puff pastry. These are known as pastizzi tax-xema, and are no less delicious!

If you’re looking for something somewhat more substantial when you have a pastizzi craving, you could also opt for an qassata, which is a kind of larger, rounder pastry (a bit like a small pie) that is made of puff pastry and contains the same fillings you’ll get with regular pastizzi. Qassatat are also commonly filled with spinach (and sometimes anchovies).

<strong>You can get them at all kinds of vendors</strong>

Sure, pastizzi might be most commonly associated with street pastizzeriji like Maxims, Champs, Sphinx, and so on (we can’t mention every single known pastizzerija – it’s impossible). While it’s very possible to get your pastizzi-fix on the go thanks to these places, there are other options you can check out.

Pastizzi are also commonly served at cafés, restaurants, and similar venues. In fact, perhaps the most famous place in Malta to get pastizzi from is the Crystal Palace in Rabat (known as is-Serkin), and that’s actually a bar you can sit at.

Eating at such places could be your preferred option as you can sit comfortably while indulging. It’s also likely that (depending on where you eat at) the pastizzi from restaurants will be a little healthier than the ones you’d get at street vendors. Just a few sit-down places to get pastizzi from are Café Jubilee, Il-Kikkra Café, Mr Maxims Jr Café, and Peristyle.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>What do you mean pastizzi can be gourmet?</strong>
<strong><img class=" size-full wp-image-1800 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/pastizzi4.jpg" alt="pastizzi4.jpg" width="960" height="640" />

Eating pastizzi at a restaurant is one thing. Eating pastizzi that the Queen of England could enjoy is another.

Pastizzi Gourmet is the brainchild of Marilu Vella, who has made ingenious steps with the idea that pastizzi can come in an assortment of flavours while still being guilt-free. The pastries you’d get at Pastizzi Gourmet are low-fat and home-made. In fact, you need to contact Marilu in advance (or go to Flora’s café in Naxxar), pick up your preferred batch, and cook them yourself. It’s completely worth it.

You don’t really go to Pastizzi Gourmet for the standard flavours. In fact, even the classics have been updated here (with variations like ‘pea and mint’). The focus here is on more unique takes on the pastizzi. The menu does change every now and then, but just to get an idea, Pastizzi Gourmet offer (or have offered in the past) gozo cheeselet, peppered pumpkin, snail, and tortilla de patatas amp; chorizo pastizzi – just to name a few!

You can even get dessert pastizzi, and the flavours here too are changed up often. Strawberry amp; chocolate were once made for Valentine’s, apple amp; Cinnamon for Lent, and blueberry amp; strawberry for election season!

<strong>
You don’t just need to be in Malta to have them</strong>

Here’s the really good news – though Pastizzi are definitely a Maltese phenomenon, you can find pastizzeriji all over the world! This is due to Maltese emigration, so pastizzi are most common in areas like Canada, Australia, and the UK.

            [blog_content] => There are several things about Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum that make it worthy of the rave reviews it constantly gets on Trip Advisor. Located in Mdina, it seamlessly combines the authenticity of the museum experience with the feel and setting of a lavish private home.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1807" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/snuff1.jpg" alt="snuff1.jpg" width="400" height="302" />

It’s not just a pretty structure, though – Palazzo Falson’s collections (of which there are 45 in total) are some of the most coveted in Malta, with an impressive display of everything from Oriental rugs to silverware and all else in between. The museum also houses a special library consisting of over 4,500 books and special manuscripts.
Palazzo Falson is also known for its frequent special exhibitions that showcase specific items alongside several gallery talks and other educational programmes. Previous years have seen exhibitions on whistles, pipes, scent bottle bottles, antique watches, and even a whole dedication on English artist Edward Lear.
Its current exhibition, titled <em>Snuff Boxes: From Accessories to Objets D'art</em>, has actually been open to the public since last December, but you’re still well in time to pay a visit. The exhibition will keep running till the 26<sup>th</sup> of February, giving you just around a month and a half to immerse yourself in this snuffbox experience.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1810" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/snuff2.gif" alt="snuff2.gif" width="480" height="366" />
Furthermore, the exhibition runs every week from Tuesday to Sunday, between 10 am and 4.30 pm. Not great hours for anyone working a fulltime job, but if you’re just visiting Malta on holiday or are working more flexible hours, it really is a must see, and you could make it a single stop into a whole day trip to Mdina. If you need even further motive, the exhibition is completely free of charge!
So why look at snuffboxes, of all things? Sure, the Palazzo Falson exhibition perfectly captures this historical fascination with a kind of item that might seem somewhat outdated in today’s context. Yet this is not simply a case of putting the spotlight on an item which is not commonplace anymore. The fact of the matter is that these decorative boxes have always been artistic wonders as much as they have been practical tools.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1812" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/snuff3.gif" alt="snuff3.gif" width="480" height="270" />
If the 200 snuff boxes Palazzo Falson has put together for this exhibition won’t convince you of that, nothing will! While many of these snuff boxes have been sourced from other museums, some of them have been gathered from private collections, meaning that Palazzo Falson is giving a first-time look into some historically noteworthy items. Other related artefacts contextualising the history of the snuffbox will also be on display.
This stunning display is a treat in itself, but the really ardent history fans might need their appetites for knowledge satiated even further. Thanks to a series of gallery talks being given in conjunction with the exhibition, this too in possible! Taking place at the museum itself are a total of three talks – one per month. The December talk has already been given, of course, but do remember to check out the next ones, as they are happening on the 20<sup>th</sup> of January and 17<sup>th</sup> of February, respectively.

            [blog_content] => Most of our articles have to do with things to do and see in Malta. In other words, what and where the hotspots and must-visits are.
This article is a bit different; a little bit more on the informative side of things. You might have heard that Malta is currently undertaking the presidency role of the Council of the EU. That might sound pretty fancy (even if you don’t know the implications of that are), but we’re here to explain why exactly this is a big deal for Malta, and why you automatically get bragging rights for being in Malta during this exciting time, whether you’re a citizen or visitor!
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1818" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/maltaeu1.gif" alt="maltaeu1.gif" width="480" height="360" />
You might have also heard that in 2018, Valletta will be the Cultural Capital for Europe. Because this coincides so closely with Malta’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, many people are lumping them together. Before we get further into this article, we just want to stress that they’re actually two separate things, although the pairing of the two together has certainly led to an abundance of new cultural opportunities in Malta (but that’s an article for the future!).
The idea that the presidency of the EU Council should be divided amongst the different member states is relatively a rather new idea in terms of legislation. In fact, it only dates back to the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The thought-process behind this practise is that every country that handles the presidency role can offer something new to the working dynamic and scope of the EU, while further providing stability to the democratic and balanced principles upheld by the institution.
What you might not know about this arrangement is that Malta is not technically handling the role in isolation. Rather, what is implemented is a Trio Presidency dynamic is which three different member states of the EU liaise together over an 18<sup>th</sup> month period. The current Trio Presidency is made up of Malta, The Netherlands, and Slovakia.
What changes is that with every 6-month period there is a shift of the dominant presiding country, and from the 1<sup>st</sup> of January till the 30<sup>th</sup> of June 2017 the spotlight is on Malta. The chosen site to run the presidency from is the Grand Master’s Palace in Valletta, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a design that dates as far back as 1571. It has a rich political history even prior to its 2017 role. First used as the official residence of the Knights of St. John, and later the house of the British Governor, the Palace eventually became Malta’s first house of Representatives after the island achieved independence.
This is all well and good, but what does this mean for Malta and the EU, exactly? Here is a list of things you can expect for Malta during the first half of 2017:
<strong>A Unique Theme</strong>
For its Presidency, Malta has selected the theme of rEUnion. More than a clever pun, rEUnion represents the importance of European connectivity, and further challenging the limits of what a European citizen is defined by.  As the Presidency has stated itself, rEUnion is not simply about legislation, but is rather much more challenging European ideologies and lifestyles. In other words, the Presidency doesn’t claim to be able to achieve the whole of this scope in just 6 months – but it certainly aims to get the vehicle rolling.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1820" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/maltaeu2.gif" alt="maltaeu2.gif" width="480" height="258" />
<strong>A Set of Unique Goals</strong>
A theme like rEUnion of course comes with a very particular set of challenges. One of these challenges concerns a very pressing European issue, namely migration. The Malta Presidency seeks to sow the seeds to create a more holistic approach to migration, with aims such as strengthening the quality of the Common European Asylum System and improved load-sharing.
This issue of migration will be tackled in addition to other important ones, such as European security and further economic development such as through the positive exploitation of the Single Market.
<strong>
New Cultural Opportunities</strong>
The Malta Presidency of the Council of the EU is not about Malta, of course – it’s about the benefit of the EU. However, for anyone who may happen to be in Malta during this period, there is quite a lot to look forward to in terms of cultural events. One which we’re particularly excited about is Ode to Joy: A Citizen Orchestra.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DkPeTyqd1s
Taking place on the 14<sup>th</sup> of May at the Royal Theatre Square, the orchestra is a collaboration between conductor Tim Steiner, Ricardo Baptista, and everybody who wants to take part. The Citizen Orchestra is exactly that – an orchestra that every Maltese citizen, musically trained or not, can take part in. It’s a way of offering a new, dynamic take on music, and is looking to be a rousing show for spectators as well as a unique opportunity for citizens.

            [blog_content] => This year, Carnival is taking place between the 24<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> of February, making this article a month early in the calendar. You might be perplexed by this, but considering how seriously the Maltese take Carnival, with some diehards working towards the event all year round, an announcement just a month prior sounds just about right!



<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1827" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/carnival2.jpg" alt="carnival2.jpg" width="612" height="340" />
<em>Photo credit: www.epicurious.com</em>
Indeed, Carnival has a rich history in Malta, having been celebrated at least since the arrival of the Knights of St John in 1535. Some newer sources even suggest that Carnival celebrations predate this era, and go back all the way to 1470.

‘Carnival is a big deal in most countries around the world’, you might be thinking. ‘What makes Carnival in Malta worth visiting above what we’d find elsewhere?’

It’s a fair question, but the fact of the matter is that carnival isn’t a competition. Malta might not have the same carnival that somewhere like Rio does – but Rio doesn’t have the same carnival that Malta does, and that’s perfectly OK. They can both be carnivals worth experiencing! However, this article is all about Maltese Carnival, and what makes it unique. Read on to find out what’s worth checking out should you be in our archipelago this February.

You might already have anticipated this, but Valletta is the main axis around which Carnival in Malta rotates. This is not simply the case because Valletta is our capital city though, but rather because the tradition of Carnival stems all the way to the time of the Knights of the Order of St. John (as mentioned), and this city was their official residence during the majority of their stay.

In other words, Valletta is the place to be if you want to find all kinds of people, from children to the elderly. More importantly, though, it’s the place to be if you want to experience the real Carnival tradition in Malta, complete with singing, dancing, music, food, games, and carnival floats.

The carnival floats, of course, are the real point of intrigue year after year for anybody visiting Valletta. Always whacky and over-the-top, Maltese Carnival Floats can cover a wide range of themes and people, which means that the team responsible for making them doesn’t even mind poking fun at local politicians and personalities at times! Current Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, for example, is just one of the several people who has been turned into a float before.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1829 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/carnival3.jpg" alt="carnival3.jpg" width="620" height="413" />

If you’re not Maltese, you might need a friend to help you understand all the references used for the floats, but it’s all in good fun! Either way, you can appreciate them simply for the impressive construction work and fine detail, whether you catch them as they parade in Valletta, or whether you inspect them as they’re at a standstill.

Another Carnival tradition that takes place in Valletta and is definitely worth checking out is a dance known as ‘Il-Parata’. Dating back to the times of the Knights, this dance re-enacts the 1565 siege between the Maltese and the Ottoman Empire. For many years, it was considered to be the most essential part of the festivities. This dance was revived in 2006, and nowadays it is mostly children who participate.

If you’re in the mood for a more adult, more macabre carnival, your best solution is to get to Nadur in Gozo, which has long become recognised as the other hotspot for the feast in the Maltese Islands. More child-friendly celebrations take place in Victoria, Gozo’s capital city, but you’ll definitely want to call the babysitter if you’re planning to head on down to Nadur, where you’ll find a real party vibe. Here, people tend to don costumes that range from ghoulish to somewhat explicit. It’s definitely a place where people can let loose and forget their concerns!

Where will you be this carnival? Are you interested in the traditional Valletta carnival way of doing things, or are you more of a Nadur person? There’s plenty of time to find out – just don’t miss out on the festivities this year!

            [blog_content] => When you next fancy a walk in Malta, skip the greener areas and instead opt for a stroll in one of Malta’s seaside cities, like Marsaxlokk. You’ll inevitably be enthralled by the abundance of boats everywhere – boats that you might only have seen before on postcards.

We’re not talking about luxurious yachts and speed boats, but rather Maltese traditional boats. This article is going to delve into the common types of traditional boats you’ll find in Malta, but if after reading you find yourself craving a bit more knowledge, there’s one event you really need to get to.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1837 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu6.gif" alt="luzzu6" width="384" height="270" />

That event, organised by Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, is taking place on the 9<sup>th</sup> of February, and is a talk aptly titled ‘The Boats of Malta’. Delivered by Professor Anthony Aquilina, the talk is the result of research by world-famous anthropologist Desmond Morris, who actually resided in Malta for 6 years. Morris’ study was lost for decades and rediscovered recently, which makes the February event a special one indeed.

Professor Aquilina’s talk, which will be held at the Palazzo de la Salle, is guaranteed to be a fascinating insight into the tradition and deep history of one of Malta’s national icons, so for more information about how to reserve a seat check out <a href="http://new.faa.org.mt/events/">new.faa.org.mt/events</a> and <a href="http://www.ticketengine.faa.org.mt">www.ticketengine.faa.org.mt</a>.

Before deciding if that talk is for you or not, though, read through this article. Consider it to be an informal introduction to Maltese boats of sorts! There won’t be a test afterwards, but you will be able to impress your friends and family by schooling them on everything you know a-boat the subject! Your main interest at this point will be to learn how to distinguish between the following types of boats:

<strong>Luzzu</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1839 alignright" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu2.jpg" alt="luzzu2.jpg" width="844" height="633" />











Luzzus are probably Malta’s most well-known boat, which is not surprising considering their unique appearance. This traditional fishing boat is always coloured in bright shades of blue, yellow, green and red, and its bow always dons its most distinctive feature: a pair of eyes. The eye, known as the Eye of Horus or the Eye of Osiris, is traditionally said to protect fishermen at sea.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1841" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu3.jpg" alt="luzzu3.jpg" width="642" height="485" />


Luzzus are commonly used as fishing vessels, although you might be lucky enough to find one that is also used as a passenger vessel. These boats are believed to have been around since ancient times, so it’s not surprising that some changes can be noted throughout history. The most obvious one of these is that luzzus are now motorised, whereas in the past they would have sails. Nowadays, in fact, it is quite rare to see a luzzu with a sail!
Though the double-hulled luzzu itself predates the language, the name derives from the Sicilian <em>guzzu</em>, which is a type of transport and fishing vessel in itself. The Maltese luzzu is its own creation, though, with unique customs associated with it. For example, when a member of a fishing family passes away, this is marked on the boat itself as a small homage.
<strong>Dgħajsa

</strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1844" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu4.jpg" alt="luzzu4.jpg" width="908" height="681" />

Though <em>dgħajsa</em> is actually the general Maltese word for boat, when one talks about the Maltese dgħajsa then he is referring a kind of water taxi that is specific to our islands. Like the luzzu, the dgħajsa is believed to date back to Phoenician times. Truly a Maltese symbol, the dgħajsa appeared on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Malta#Coat_of_Arms_used_between_1975_and_1988">coat of arms of Malta</a> from 1975 to 1988.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1846 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/luzzu5.jpg" alt="luzzu5.jpg" width="220" height="234" />

In many ways a take on the gondola, the Maltese Dgħajsa was mostly used in the Grand Harbour area, but of course could be found all over Malta. Such is the case that the different colours used to decorate the boats were often chosen based on the different harbours they were used at. Today, few remaining dgħajsas (or dgħajjes in Maltese) survive as functioning water taxis, but some are still used as transportation between Birgu and Valletta.
<strong>Other kinds of Maltese boats</strong>

Though not as common as the Luzzu and Dgħajsa, there are a few other Maltese boats that are certainly worthy of mention, including:
<ul>
	<li>The Kajjik, which is in many ways a smaller luzzu but has a square transom instead of a double ended-hull</li>
	<li>The Gozo boat (now largely extinct) which is more or less a larger luzzu with lateen sails</li>
	<li>The Dgħajsa tal-Midalji, a more modern version of the Dgħajsa which is often used in the local Regatta rowing race</li>
</ul>

            [blog_content] => On this blog, we love to emphasise time and again just how great Malta’s live music scene is. 2017’s first few months are already looking to be extremely vibrant in terms of concerts, with a rich mix of local and foreign acts promising to leave their mark all over our shores (Iron Maiden’s ex-singer, Blaze Bailey, is one such act, and you don’t need to be a spandex-wearing rocker to find that exciting).

However, because our affinity lies with all things Maltese, this article is going to focus specifically on a local band, nosnow/noalps, that will be celebrating its 10-year anniversary just a few days later on the 17<sup>th</sup> of February. Taking place at The Palace Theatre in Paola, the concert is titled ‘Moving Mountains – 10 Years of nosnow/noalps’. Tickets are priced at €12 per seat or €15 at special tables seating four. You can find much more information at the event page <strong>here</strong>.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1851" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/nosnow1.jpg" alt="nosnow1" width="1656" height="628" />

‘Iron Maiden, nosnow/noalps are not’, you might be thinking. ‘What makes this Maltese band worth my time?’ For anybody who might be new to the Maltese music scene, it’s a fair question. If you were to dig just a little deeper, though, you’d find out that nosnow/noalps are one of the more important bands in the Maltese rock scene.

The band formed in 2007, and released its debut EP, <em>(just rock),</em> a year later. Whether the choice of title was ironic or not is uncertain, but what is certain that <em>(just rock)</em> is definitely not a straightforward rock EP. A benchmark for the trademark nosnow/noalps sound, <em>(just rock)</em> featured bouncy guitar riffs, but these were coupled with poppy, catchy vocals (both male and female) and ska/reggae-influenced rhythms. Check out the trademark single from this era, Taking My Time, to see just what we mean:



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhf6ko4K_kU



It’s not surprising, then, that when nosnow/noalps began making waves, they were waves that stuck. The band had a distinctive sound that was unique without being cluttered - rooted enough in the rock genre to make your head bop but diverse enough to stray away from the conventions of the genre.

When the band entered the studio to record its first full-length album in 2010, expectations were high. Those expectations were met in the form of ROMANTIKPOLITIK, an album that is still considered to be a favourite in the local scene today. The release not only captured the sound that fans had come to expect from the band, but it presented it in a more mature, 14-track format. Notable singles from this time, to name a few, include Far into the Night (Without You) and Elizabeth, I.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrzXKePFUH4



After that, the band entered a new era, with a few notable line-up changes and a move to Denmark that lasted a good few months. The result of that new life was <em>Go Go Go Go</em>, the band’s 3rd release, launched in 2014. With this album, nosnow/noalps did the smart thing and evolved its sound slightly. Flourishes of <em>ROMANTIKPOLITIK</em> are evident, of course, but the album is far from <em>ROMANTIKPOLITIK PT. 2.</em> Indeed, one pleasant surprise on the album is the inclusion of more aggressive and punky influences on certain tracks, such as <em>Black Panther</em>, which has a nice amount of grit while still being a danceable party song.

Unfortunately, fans have to wait a little bit for news regarding a new album, but Kaleidoscopes, a mesmerising single released in 2015 scratched the itch for a good while. Featuring dreamy guitar tones and a heavy emphasis on trumpet, Kaleidoscopes is one of the band’s strongest songs yet – but that’s only whet our collective appetite for even more new material.

The 17th of February is not about new material, though. Rather, it’s about celebrating the rich discography that nosnow/noalps has given us in its current 10-year old story. Such is the case that the band will be accompanied by numerous guests, many of whom can be directly traced to the band’s history.

Let’s turn back to the question we posed at the beginning of this article: ‘What makes nosnow/noalps worth your time?’

Here, we’re not simply dealing with a Maltese band that has been around for 10 years. There are plenty of those already. Rather, this is a band that has done a whole lot in those 10 years. With a handful of releases and even more anthems that are iconic on a local level, nosnow/noalps is a band that represents the pinnacle of creativity and hard work in the Maltese music scene. If that’s not worth your time, we don’t know what is.

            [blog_content] => It’s hard to pin down what makes Carnival such a lovable exercise in festivities, year after year. To anyone with a bout of scepticism, Carnival can seem rowdy, loud, gaudy and wild. To the optimistic eye, that is precisely the point – Carnival is not like any other time of the year. It’s a colourful spectrum of letting loose and celebration, and maybe the fact that it inspires so much joy to people of all ages is a telling sign that we need to add some more colour to our daily routine.

That doesn’t mean we’d vouch for more frequent carnivals, though! Just like how the magic of Christmas presents would be lost if we received them every day, the traditions of Carnival are special because you’re not going to find them regularly in Malta. This is especially true of the special confectionaries and sweets that become available in Malta and Gozo during the Carnival period.

These sweet treats are absolutely heavenly, but would you want them to be available all year round? Instinctively, we’d shout a resounding yes – but the truth is that waiting for the whole year to pass so that you can get your hands on a portion on these scrumptious goods makes them taste even better!

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1865" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats.jpg?w=300" alt="treats" width="300" height="234" />



If you’re new to Maltese Carnival, though, you’re probably not partaking in the collective mouth-watering just yet. What are these magical carnival treats, and where can one find them? The answer to the second question is quite simply ‘everywhere’, but the first requires a bit more depth. Luckily for you, we’re providing the answer throughout the rest of the article.

The first thing to stress here is that if you go to just about any place celebrating Carnival this year, you’re going to find the usual street vendors selling an assortment of sugary goods, like ice creams and doughnuts. That’s not we mean when we’re talking about traditional carnival treats, of course! Delicious as they might be, if you’re looking to sample our more traditional offerings, try out some of the below:

<strong>Prinjolata</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1861" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats1.jpg" alt="treats1.jpg" width="459" height="306" />
<em>Photo credit: www.tisjir.com </em>
If we were to conduct a poll asking which Carnival treat was the overall favourite, we’re sure that Prinjolata would take the cake. Often considered to be the quintessential Carnival treat, this would be the one to sample if you could only limit yourself to one sweet (but why torture yourself like that?).

Prinjolata is a kind of cake that is made first by blending ‘pan di spagna’ sponge with cocoa nibs, pine nuts, and cherries. That is the body of the cake, and it is then covered in succulent cream, drizzled melted chocolate, and more cherries. You don’t need us to tell you it’s not the best cake to eat on a diet. Indeed, ‘sinful’ and ‘decadent’ are two great words to choose when describing prinjolata cakes, but arguably that just makes them even more appropriate as a pre-Lent indulgence!



<strong>Perlini</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1862" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats2.jpg" alt="treats2.jpg" width="350" height="263" />

Simply put, perlini are almonds cased in a strong sugar coating. They’re colourful and definitely will hit the spot if you find yourself craving that sugary, nutty taste, but we would like to offer a word of caution first: perlini are usually quite hard. Biting into them is definitely not the wisest choice – instead opt for sucking on them till they soften up.

It might seem like a silly or even obvious thing to say – however, perlini are mostly enjoyed by children, so passing on the message to your kids is a simple way of avoiding unexpected and unwanted trips to the dentist this Carnival!

We’re not trying to diss perlini, of course – they’re great fun in their sweet simplicity. They also have a very particular place in Maltese Carnival history. Perlini used to be thrown to children by people on top of the carnival floats.



<strong>Sfrappole (and similar Sicilian treats)</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1863" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/treats3.jpg" alt="treats3.jpg" width="620" height="465" />

Because of Malta’s proximity to Sicily, you’ll find a few places offering some of Sicily’s coveted Carnival treats. One such treat is ‘Sfrappole’, and is simply fried dough that is sprinkled with powdered sugar. It might sound underwhelming and simple, but it’s quite delicious – think of it as kannoli (another popular treat in Malta) pastry without the ricotta filling!

            [blog_content] => Shipwrecks are tragedies, of course, unless they somehow manage to instil a new religious faith to an entire nation for centuries to come. That’s how the story goes in Malta – St. Paul, now the Patron Saint of Malta, landed on our islands after a divinely fated shipwreck, and the rest is history.

To commemorate the event, The Feast of St. Paul’s Shipwreck is celebrated every year in Malta on the 10<sup><span style="font-size:small;">th</span></sup> of February. Though this is one of the most important days in any Maltese religious devotee’s calendar, the day can be appreciated by people holding any beliefs – and not just for the long weekend that’s coming their way, either.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1873 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/stpaul1.jpg" alt="stpaul1" width="540" height="340" />
<em>Photo credit: </em><a href="http://www.palazzoconsiglia.com/"><em>www.palazzoconsiglia.com</em></a>
The Feast of St. Paul’s Shipwreck is about the entirety of the Catholic Faith in Malta, but the implications here are much more than religious. Catholicism has such a huge cultural hold in Malta that to celebrate St. Paul’s shipwreck is also a way of celebrating its effects on a historical level, architectural level, and so on.

<strong>How the story goes: </strong>St. Paul allegedly landed in Malta in 60 AD, making Malta’s introduction to Christianity one of the earliest on a global scale. Showing the way of Christ to the Maltese wasn’t exactly St. Paul’s (back then known simply as Paul), though.

Paul was actually on the way to Rome against his will – he was going to be on trial for crimes against the Roman Empire for attempting to convert people to Christianity. However, the ship got caught in a storm, with the result being that two weeks later the ship was wrecked on the Maltese coast.

If that didn’t sound enough like a pretty bad weekend, Paul was later bit by a poisonous snake after the Maltese welcomed him and his peers around a fire. Here’s the thing though – Paul didn’t incur any illness as a result. We reckon that this is the time that the Maltese started taking Paul and his message a little bit more seriously.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1876 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/stpaul2.jpg" alt="stpaul2.jpg" width="1024" height="660" />L<em>aurent de La Hyre’s ‘Saint Paul Shipwrecked on Malta’, 1630</em>

After that, Paul stayed in Malta for quite a while longer, initially taking refuge in a cave in Rabat that is today known as St. Paul’s Grotto (to this day, Rabat is still one of the areas that is most associated with the Feast of Saint Paul’s Shipwreck). However, he eventually stayed at the house of Publius, who was the Roman chief of the islands. It was here that Paul allegedly worked a little bit more miracle magic by curing Publius of a fatal fever. Publius then converted to Christianity and became the first bishop of Malta, directing the faith of the Maltese after Paul left the islands.

<strong>Is St. Paul’s story Gospel truth? </strong> Even from a non-religious perspective, strong evidence seems to suggest that St. Paul did land in Malta, particularly because of the fact that there is archaeological proof that Malta was one of the first Roman colonies to adopt Christianity. On the other hand, some historians believe that St. Paul landed on an island closer to Greece. Ultimately, as is the case with most biblical stories, we’ll never really know – you either accept it or you don’t. The majority of the Maltese certainly do, so you might want to avoid stating controversial opinions within earshot!
<strong>What can you do on the 10<sup>th</sup> of February?</strong>

There are a few options if you want to join in on the celebrations. A special mass is heard all around the island, but you could opt to go to The Parish Church of Saint Paul in Rabat or the Church of Saint Paul’s Shipwreck in Valletta.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1881" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/stpaul3.jpg" alt="stpaul3.jpg" width="1254" height="836" /><em>The Church of Saint Paul’s Shipwreck, Valletta
</em>

If you opt to go to Rabat, you could then visit Saint Paul’s Grotto, which as mentioned Saint Paul is said to have taken refuge in. Afterwards you could opt to eat at one of the many wonderful restaurants in the vicinity.

If you go to Valletta, there’s quite a bit of activity to look forward to. The church itself is a work of beauty and is home to several ancient relics and artefacts pertaining to Saint Paul, including his wrist bone. After the mass you could witness the procession of Saint Paul’s statue from the church through the streets of Valletta. This procession is of course accompanied by lots of confetti, marching band music, and overall liveliness. For the early birds, fireworks are exploded over the Grand Harbour after the 8 am mass in Valletta!

            [blog_content] => Valentine’s Day is around the corner. Whether you’re planning to spend the day with your wife, long-term girlfriend, new lover, or someone you’re simply testing the waters with, you might be wondering how you’re going to impress your partner. How are you going to sweep them off their feet and whisk them into your arms if you don’t plan the perfect Valentine’s date?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1894 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine.gif" alt="valentine" width="600" height="360" />

Hold on for a second, though. Remember that you’re in <em>Malta</em>, one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Sure, you can go the expensive route and book an expensive restaurant or hotel, and we’re pretty sure that you’ll have an incredible Valentine’s day.

However, if you really want to make the most out of the fact that you’re in Malta, you could instead opt to spend the day with a picnic at one of the most scenic landscapes our islands have to offer (and if you’re cheesy enough, you could take the opportunity to compare your partner to the breath-taking views around you. We promise it will work.)

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1897" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine2.gif" alt="valentine2.gif" width="480" height="360" />

Spending Valentine’s day in nature isn’t just more beautiful and poetic – it’s also much more personal. Forget the noise and background chattering that you get in restaurants and similar areas. Your special day should be private and intimate – shared only by you, your lover, and the wind and trees around you. The personal quality of your date will be highlighted with your choice of picnic foods. Sure, top-tier restaurants know how to cook amazing food, and they’ll know how to create a special menu that really sets the mood for Valentine’s day. You know what they don’t know, though? The unique relationship you and your partner share. Try cooking each other’s favourite foods, or creating a surprise menu for each other. Alternatively, take the opportunity to break out Maltese aphrodisiac foods, like our superb local honey!

Without further ado, here a few places to choose from when planning your perfect Valentine’s Day picnic. If you plan on making it a total surprise, do keep in mind that some of these areas are pretty cliffy, so we’d suggest not going so far as to use a blindfold.

<strong>Ta’ Qali National Park, Attard</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1899 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine11.jpg" alt="valentine1" width="1024" height="768" />

This park is a first-choice Sunday afternoon location for many families, but it can work just as well as a Romantic Valentine’s spot. Valentine’s is happening on a Tuesday this year, so if you’re faithful to the date it’ll probably be much quieter than usual. However, if you do keep your plans for the weekend you might find quite a few kids bustling about in the grass. On the plus side (and we think this is a huge plus), you’ll probably also get to meet a few family dogs as a result.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buskett_Gardens"><strong>Buskett Gardens</strong></a><strong>, Siġġiewi </strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1901" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine2.jpg" alt="valentine2.jpg" width="800" height="531" />

Allegedly, in the time of the Romans, Buskett Gardens was used as a site for sexual activity in order to celebrate their gods. In other words, it’s already been tried and tested as a perfect location for Valentine’s Day! Of course, we don’t condone getting that frisky in any public area.

Located in Siġġiewi, Buskett Gardens is a gorgeous woodlands site that has been given a lot of attention throughout history, particularly by the Knights of St John who planted various gardens in the area. As a result, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more gorgeous location for your special picnic, especially if you’re looking for shade.

Wied il-Għasel, Mosta

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1903 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine3.jpg" alt="valentine3.jpg" width="500" height="375" />

Wied il-Għasel is perfect for trekking, but you’ll definitely want to watch your step here. It’s a large, spacious area, making it excellent for finding an intimate spot where you can spend time with your partner undisturbed. The fact that one of the most beautiful songs to ever come out of Malta is written about it is a huge plus.

Picnics are allowed here, but do make sure you clean up and barbecues are definitely a no-no (to be fair, this is the case with all the areas on this list). Lots of environmental concern has been raised over Wied il-Għasel in recent years, and such a gorgeous spot should be respected.

<strong>Chadwick Lakes, Mtarfa</strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1905 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine4.jpg" alt="valentine4.jpg" width="960" height="720" />

Located in Mtarfa, Chadwick Lakes forms the longest valley in Malta, and is made up of a number of dams constructed by Sir Osbert Chadwick during the period of the British Empire. Can you think of anything more romantic than spending an evening next to so many lakes? We didn’t think so!

<strong>Għajn Tuffieħa, or any other beach</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1906" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/valentine5.jpg" alt="valentine5.jpg" width="595" height="324" />

If you like the idea of a picnic but aren’t too keen on grassy fields and rocky areas, choose from one of the uncountable amount of beaches we have in Malta! Do, of course, keep in mind that if you have your picnic at night, it will get pretty chilly since you’ll be next to the sea, but that would just give you extra incentive to snuggle up with your loved one.

            [blog_content] => It’s easy to get trapped into a routine with no exercise in it. It’s only February, and you might be one of the hundreds of people who already have new-year-resolution gym membership cards that are gathering dust.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/marathon.gif" alt="marathon.gif" width="600" height="600" />

We’re not judging. Having to juggle between work and your busy life outside it can make you lose sight of the treadmill. In addition to this, when you spend time in another country, the last thing you’re likely to think about is working out – with all the places to see and all the foods to try, you might quickly find your waistline expanding.
The Vodafone Malta Marathon, an annual event, gives you the opportunity to exercise with a greater purpose in mind, so it’s time to shed your excuses (and possibly a few pounds while you’re at it).
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1917" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/marathon2.gif" alt="marathon2.gif" width="335" height="335" />

This year, all the proceeds collected through the marathon will go the Inspire Foundation, a charity which works with people who suffer from Down Syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy, and various other disabilities.

If you’re more interested in the competitive edge, you’re in luck too, as an award ceremony is hosted on the same day at 8.30 pm at Le Méridien, St Julians Hotel amp; Spa. Winning categories include 1st 3 Men, 1st 3 Ladies, 1st 3 Male Teams, and 1st 3 Female teams.

If you’re up for the good deed, the Vodafone Malta Marathon is happening on the 5th of March this year. People are still in time to participate, as applications close on the 19th of February. That’s only a few days away, so don’t take too long to decide! Keep in mind that you need to be at least 18 to take part in the full marathon and at least 17 to take part in the half marathon.

If you’re not really up to the full marathon, you can opt instead to take part in a Half Marathon or a Walkathon (which is technically part of the Half Marathon, but walking participants must remain behind the joggers/runners), which are both happening on the same day.

All three variations of the marathon begin in Mdina, but whereas the full marathon starts at 7.30 am, the other two commence at 9.30 am. If you want to know what the exact difference between the full and half marathons is, the time limit for the former is 5.5 hours, while the half marathon lasts for only 3 hours and 45 minutes. The full marathon amounts to a 42.195km route while the half marathon totals to 21.097km.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1921 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/marathon31.gif" alt="marathon3" width="500" height="282" />

The organisers have chosen to keep the same routes used last year. Funnily enough, regardless of whether you take on the full or half marathon, the route will start in Mdina and end in Sliema, but the full marathon will cover a wider area in between. For more information on the route, you can check out the following link:

In fact, if you need more information in general (including how to participate and what the application fees are), your best bet is to head over to the official site of the marathon:

            [blog_content] => We just wrote an article on the upcoming Vodafone Malta Marathon, which would explain why we’ve got fitness on the brain!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1928" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/workout-1.gif" alt="workout 1.gif" width="425" height="300" />

Joking aside, the Vodafone Malta Marathon is going to provide a great opportunity to exercise for an even greater cause – but that’s a one-time, annual affair that lasts a few hours. If you’re gaining interest in making working out a more permanent part of your lifestyle, you’ll want to check out some of the places in Malta that are most equipped to make you sweat.

The places we’ve chosen for this article all have different price points for different durations of membership, and with many of these options you can even pay for a single visit. This means that you can get started on your fitness routine even if you’re only staying in Malta for a short while. You could be leaving the island tomorrow, and you’d still have time to squeeze in a workout!

We also tried to find places that could offer you a variety of workout options. The most conventional thing to do when looking to get fit is to find a well-equipped gym that has a mixed selection of cardio and weight machines. We’ve certainly packed in quite a few gyms here, but we’ve also got a few alternatives if you’re looking for something a tad different. Although, it’s really essential to keep in mind that nowadays gyms tend to be quite varied, and often offer all sorts of fitness classes.
<strong>24/7 Fitness Club (Mellieha, St Paul’s Bay, San Gwann, Ta’ Qali, Santa Lucia)</strong>

As you might have noted, getting a membership with the 24/7 Fitness Club is a great option for anyone who might be in Malta for a relatively long period of time, or for anyone who happens to travel around the island a lot.
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1929" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/workout-2.gif" alt="workout 2.gif" width="500" height="360" />

You can use your membership at all of the five localities they’ve set up at. Apart from localities, you also get access to quite a few facilities, including a gym, free classes, and saunas (where available). The best part, of course, is that it’s true to its name – you can visit any one of these gyms whenever you like, even if you crave a workout at 5am!

<strong>YUE (Naxxar)</strong>

YUE is the place to sign up if you really want a chance to try out everything. Is a regular gym not enough for you? That’s fine – with YUE you can also get personal trainer services, an array of classes (such as yoga and Pilates), and pool facilities that include lap training, hydrotherapy and more. There’s even a gym for kids, and pre and post-natal exercises classes. Need we go on?

We haven’t even touched upon the treatment and consultancy services, with nutrition and physiotherapy being just a few of the services offered.

<strong>Sky Spirit (Luqa)</strong>

Sky Spirit is one of those gym centres that is so comprehensive that you really can’t complain about it at all. This health centre prides itself on a mix of traditional as well as more unique equipment that offers custom workouts to people of all levels of fitness. Since it’s located in Luqa, it’s a wonderful option for anyone who lives closer to the south of Malta. It’s actually quite close to the airport – do you have the stamina to sneak a workout in before your next flight?

<strong>Pilates Centre (St George’s Bay)

</strong>If you want to get healthier without resorting to conventional offerings, Pilates might be for you. A form of exercise that relies on core strength, Pilates is known for significantly reducing back problems and other kinds of physical pain.

The Pilates Centre is located in the Marina hotel at the Corinthia beach resort. You can opt for a number of class layouts, including one-on-one, one-on-two, or group classes with up to eight participants.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1930" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/workout-3.gif" alt="workout 3.gif" width="399" height="224" />

<strong>Zumba with Wesley and Ilona (San Gwann, Gozo)</strong>

If you ever thought that workouts should be more like dance parties, Zumba may be for you. Both hailing from The Netherlands, Wesley and Ilona organise a series of classes (in various locations, although mostly at the San Gwann primary school) that they claim will help you lose weight without any of dread that comes with conventional exercising. A huge plus is that anyone aged 12 onwards is encouraged to take part in the fun!

<strong>Westin Dragonara (St Julian’s)</strong>

If you really want an upper-end solution to get your workout regime in motion, you might want to check out any offerings that a 4 or 5-star resort  might have (you generally won’t have to be staying at the hotel to work out there).

The Westin Dragonara is just one example of a fitness centre that will make sweating feel like a luxury. Here, you’ll get access to a gym, tennis court, sauna, indoor pool, and Jacuzzi. Working out probably never felt this good.

            [blog_content] => This weekend is going to be bursting with Carnival related activities, but with so much noise and bustle in the streets we wouldn’t be surprised if you were looking for an alternative. If you’re set on a slightly different show, we’ve got a suggestion for you – how about you check out a Pro Wrestling match?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1935 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/wrestling2.jpg" alt="wrestling2.jpg" width="960" height="572" />

We’re willing to bet that quite a few people aren’t even aware that Malta has such an active wrestling scene, and this would be understandable since the first event organised by Pro Wrestling Malta only took place in 2015. Since then, the group has been going strong and <em>Hail to the King</em>, taking place on the 25<sup>th</sup> of February at the Montekristo Estates, is just another event in a series of events set to put Malta on the map as a wrestling hub.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1938" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/wrestling3.gif" alt="wrestling3.gif" width="278" height="278" />

Pro Wrestling Malta might be relatively new as an organisation, but that does not mean they’re subpar. If you want proof of this, you only need to check out the following video, which is a montage of clips from a previous wrestling event. It’s easy to get a feel of the Pro Wrestling Malta approach, which to us seems modelled on the more famous TV wrestling programs like WWE and RAW. In other words, you can expect a blend of good old fashioned wrestling with a substantial chunk of that cheesy banter thrown in for good measure. What more could you ask for?

https://www.facebook.com/prowrestlingmalta/videos/1899459463599011/

Don’t expect a cheap soap opera, though. Names like Gianni Valletta and Glamorous Roddy might make you smile, but all of the wrestlers in the Pro Wrestling Malta roster have had plenty of training. Gianni Valletta, for example, spent many years wrestling in the UK. He’s also the main trainer of the Pro Wrestling Malta Academy, located in Zurrieq (If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to wrestle, this is the place to check out).

One of the reasons why Hail to the King is looking to be so exciting is that it will be hosting quite a few international wrestlers from all over the world, including Rob Cage (UK), Red Scorpion (Italy), ‘Sensei of Chops’ Kenzo Richards (Netherlands), ‘The Don’ Francesco Messina (Sicily), and ‘The Super Human’ Lance Lawrence (whose country of origin is currently listed as unknown).

In fact, the main event of the evening is going to be a special match between Gianni Valletta and Red Scorpion. Pro Wrestling Malta are being somewhat secretive about the details of this match, stating only that stipulations of the match are in the hands of Red Scorpion, so there’s a strong mystery element that has us intrigued.

            [blog_content] => Heavy metal has never been known as a particularly polite or accessible genre of music. Many misperceive it as a rowdy and violent genre with even rowdier and more violent fans. The reality is quite the opposite, though – heavy metal fans are simply enthralled by the diverse array of sounds that you can find within the genre. Despite the stereotypes, it has a very inclusive, welcoming culture.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1948" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/metal1.gif" alt="metal1.gif" width="330" height="205" />

You might not know it, but Malta has a surprisingly large heavy metal scene, with dozens of active bands and plenty of gigs and annual festivals. Event organisers also tend to invite some of the biggest names in the international metal scene to our tiny island, and the Metal Over Malta Festival, happening on the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> of March, is further proof of this. If you’re a new fan of the genre, a seasoned rocker who remembers the glory days of the 80s, or someone who is simply looking to enrichen his musical palette, Metal Over Malta is unmissable!

Currently in its third edition, the Metal Over Malta festival will be taking place at Chateau Buskett in the outskirts of Rabat. Its secluded feel makes it the perfect venue for such an event! Anyone worried about transport need not worry, as the organisers are providing solutions – but get in touch as soon as you can!

If you don’t recognise any names from the line-up listed on the festival’s Facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/673140919501836/">https://www.facebook.com/events/673140919501836/</a>), the 400+ attendees should definitely indicate that the event is definitely a big deal, considering the usual scale of more underground music concerts in Malta. Headliners Orphaned Land and Civil War are both substantial names in the genre.

Orphaned Land, from Israel, have amassed an incredibly wide following since starting out in 1992, and are famous for playing ‘Oriental Metal’, which is a combination of Middle Eastern musical influences and themes pertaining to Abrahamic religions. As you might have been able to tell, they’re pretty unique:

Civil War are a more recent band, having formed in 2012, but these hard-hitting Swedes quickly found themselves signed to a major label and gained plenty of critical acclaim for their catchy hooks and melodies. This band loves to explore themes of war and history, which means that their appearance in a historically-rich island like Malta is quite apt!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXAvNLTWNMM

These bands are so well-known that the festival organisers even saw it fit to organise meet-and-greets for both of them! Fans can meet with Civil War on Friday 10<sup>th</sup> March at 9 pm, and Orphaned Land on Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> March at 8 pm.

The rest of line-up is made up of plenty of lesser known (but still great quality) international act and four local bands, namely Animamortua, Weeping Silence, Abysmal Torment and Forsaken. Though Animamortua is a newer (but still formidable) band, the other three names are respected as big names locally as well as on the international circuit. Indeed, all three bands have played at numerous festivals abroad throughout their long histories (Forsaken celebrated its 25-year anniversary just last November).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcyDasI970I

Weeping Silence is also the band responsible for organising the Metal Over Malta festival year after year, making them excellent curators in addition to great musicians!

You can find specific information about the running order here:
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/metalovermalta/photos/gm.782621745220419/1564451396915716/?type=3amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/metalovermalta/photos/gm.782621745220419/1564451396915716/?type=3amp;theater</a>

Ticket prices at the door for the festival run at 40 euro for both days, or 20 euro for Friday/30 euro for Saturday. That might seem slightly pricey if you’re a more casual music fan, but considering the impressive headliners, overall quality of the acts, and guaranteed excellent of the festival in general, we can promise that the price is well worth it.

            [blog_content] => Ladies and gentlemen, the future is now. Or rather, the future is later this month. If you’re a technology-nut, it’s imperative that you get down to the MFCC (Malta Fairs and Conventions Centre) on the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> of March for the Malta Robotics Olympiad 2017!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1954" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/robots3.gif" alt="robots3.gif" width="500" height="282" />

The Malta Robotics Olympiad is a free annual event, now in its sixth year, organised by the Ministry for Education an Employment in partnership with GO. Though the event is mostly aimed at student participation and is set to make younger audiences interested in technology, the event can be enjoyed by anyone who has even the slightest fascination with gizmos and gadgets! From competitions to workshops, there’s something to appeal to every single age group.

If you’re already figuring out how to pencil the dates in your calendar, don’t worry too much because the event will be open to the public for most of the weekend. On Friday 24<sup>th</sup> the event begins at 4 pm and lasts till 10.30 pm, while the next day you can go as early as 9 am, with the closing time also being 10.30 pm. Here are some of the best parts of the event to look forward to during MRO17!

The main competition during the whole competition is a Lego Sumo Competition, which is only open to Middle and Secondary School students in Forms 1-5. You can still watch the action take place if you like! This year, the competition is particularly exciting because it doubles as national qualifiers. The winning team will represent Malta in an International Lego Sumo Challenge!

For something that is bound to be a little bit more exciting to older audiences, the event to watch is the MRO Big Challenge, which is aimed at students who like a bit more intensity in their competitions. In this particular challenge, participants need to build a robot that is programmed to autonomously go through an obstacle course!

https://www.facebook.com/go.com.mt/videos/1380624998625279/

Part of MRO17 is also the Malta Drone Nationals, which is the first European Drone Racing Championship qualifier of this year’s drone racing season. This particular event will be laid out over both days of MRO17 and is looking to be one of the most exciting parts of the weekend. The Malta Drone Nationals are divided into different competition segments, including a racetrack full of stunt modules and a freestyle competition!

One of the more interactive parts of MRO17 is a Design and Technology Expo that invites the public to test out the products and inventions brought to the table by participating students. In 2016 over 400 projects were on display. If the numbers this year are similar, anyone into gadgets will see this segment of MRO as a Christmas village of sorts! Speaking of interactivity, the MRO Esports Arena, which is taking the form of a full-scale gaming tournament called Overwatch, will go down a treat for people with a knack for getting the best of games.

One segment of MRO17 that we’re really excited about is the series of EDx conferences that will be taking place. Speakers include prestigious lecturers from the University of Malta as well as a live session with CERN, from the Large Hadron Collider area!

On display this year will also be a full-scale and functioning Wall-E robot, which is bound to be a hit for anyone who’s watched the impeccable Disney Pixar film. This will be the second year that the MRO team has taken up the challenge of building a pop culture robot, as last year they successfully replicated the BB-8 Droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

All in all, if you want to whirr your wonder and electrify your excitement, MRO17 is hands down the place to be on the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> of March! For more information, visit <a href="https://mromalta.com/">https://mromalta.com/</a>.

            [blog_content] => Located in the North East part of Malta, Buġibba is definitely known for its charm. It’s one of those areas that saw rapid development in the 1960s, and quickly became a major attraction in the islands.

That being said, we feel like this particular village isn’t always given its due attention. It’s easy to overlook Buġibba, with so many other wonderful spots in Malta, but Buġibba isn’t a discount Paceville or Sliema. Rather, we’ll happily argue that Buġibba is one of the loveliest and most versatile places in Malta. Don’t take our word for it, though. Here’s a list of all the activities you can pack in a trip to Buġibba (actually, scratch that – you might need five or six separate trips to squeeze everything in!).

Don't blame us if you fall in love with this quaint town! Well, if you really can't help it, why not stay here on your trip to Malta? Check out some great accommodation options <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/Delfin_Court_2-Bedroom_Apt" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/085_Delfin_Penthouse_with_Views" target="_blank">here</a>.

N.B.: Because these villages are so connected, this article will also include attractions from the Qawra, Salina, and St. Paul’s Bay areas.

<strong> </strong>
<strong>Hang out at the village square</strong>

The Buġibba square is an iconic part of the village. Though small, it’s an excellent place to sit down, unwind, and have a chat while soaking in the sea-salty air. The square also surrounds lots of neighbouring cafes and restaurants that you can visit when you get thirsty or peckish.

<strong>Go scuba diving</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1963" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba1.gif" alt="bugibba1.gif" width="457" height="270" />

Buġibba is essentially a seaside village, and that’s not something that you can easily ignore considering that the wonderful sea breeze will follow you everywhere you turn. If you want to take your experience with the sea a step further, though, you might want to visit one of the many scuba diving centres you can find around the village!



<strong>Grab a bite to eat</strong>

From fish and chips, to meaty burgers, to classic pub food, to Indian cuisine, and more, you can really find it all at Buġibba. It’s very hard to scout the village for a proper bite to eat and not find the right eatery for you. Once you’ve filled your stomach with savoury goodness, a Buġibba dessert is a must – we recommend getting an ice cream from one of the many exquisite gelaterias in the area.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1964" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba2.gif" alt="bugibba2.gif" width="500" height="281" />

<strong>Walk along the seafront
</strong>
This one is pretty self-explanatory – we’ve already raved about the Buġibba sea about three times in this article, but you won’t understand how serene it really is unless you visit it first-hand. If the weather’s good enough (and considering that spring it just around the corner it should be) you can even walk down to one of the rocky beach areas and relax there – or even take a quick swim if you’re so inclined.



<strong>Look for megalithic ruins</strong>

This is a Buġibba secret of sorts, but the Dolmen hotel in the Qawra area is actually built around ancient megalithic findings. The placement is a little awkward, but it sure makes for an intriguing few minutes of your time.

<strong>Visit the Classic Car Museum</strong>

If you’re still in the Qawra area, the Classic Car museum is a must for vehicle enthusiasts. The collection here spans over 50 years and includes Austins, Jaguars, Triumps, Ferraris, and more.
<strong>Visit the Bird Park</strong>

Everyone loves birds! The Bird Park in Salina is great for kids and adults alike, and will make any animal-lover’s heart melt. Apart from the vast array of birds, you’ll also find some other kinds of animals here.
<strong>
Visit the Malta National Aquarium
</strong>
The Aquarium is arguably a little farther away from Buġibba but is still close enough in the area to pay a visit so long as you’re on an animal-viewing tour. The impressive collection here includes all varieties of fish, amphibians and even reptiles!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1966" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba3.gif" alt="bugibba3.gif" width="480" height="210" />
<strong>
Watch a film</strong>

The Empire cinema in Buġibba means that a great family-friendly option is always available!

<strong>Enjoy the Nightlife
</strong>
On the other hand, you’ll want to leave the kids at home if you decide to spend your weekend night out in Bugibba. There are plenty of bars, pubs, clubs, and even karaoke bars to choose from. If you want to party without the huge crowds you’ll get at Paceville and similar areas, Buġibba is definitely your best bet.

<strong>Go gambling
</strong>
That’s right, Buġibba has a few options if you enjoy wagering money to win money. The biggest hit by far here is the Oracle casino, which is the place to be if you want a huge choice of slot games, blackjack, poker, roulette, baccarat, and so on.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1968" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/bugibba4.gif" alt="bugibba4.gif" width="500" height="283" />

Another option is to check out the Fairplay Bingo Hall, which is the largest Bingo Hall in Malta. With a total of 55 tables, this is the best to be for a communitarian gambling experience.

            [blog_content] => If you’re staying or living in Malta right now, you will have heard that the great Michael McIntyre is giving a show in Malta on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of April. If so, you’re either one of the lucky ones who managed to snag a ticket before they sold out in 90 minutes, or you might be one of the hundreds of disappointed people who simply weren’t fast enough.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1980" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/standup1.gif" alt="standup1.gif" width="540" height="304" />

The demand for McIntyre was so great that a second show is now scheduled for the 21<sup>st</sup> of April, a day before the original show. The tickets for that date are now sold out too – so if you want to catch McIntyre live in action you’re either going to have to travel abroad, wait for the next one, or find someone selling his ticket (probably at a pretty ghastly upcharge).

Whether you’re watching McIntyre live in Malta or not, the excitement of the whole thing might have made you curious about Malta’s stand-up comedy culture. Is Malta the place to be if you want to have your sides split, or is the island infested by comedy try-hards?

We’re happy to report that the comedy scene in Malta is pretty good – and beyond this, it’s growing every year. This is true both in terms of local performers as well as international guests. In fact, Michael McIntyre coming to Malta is not a miraculous affair or one-off incident. 2016 alone saw the comedy giants Jimmy Carr and Omid Djalili coming to Malta, too. We also have a fair share of local comedians who might not be world famous, but can definitely hold their own alongside some bigger names.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1982" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/standup2.gif" alt="standup2.gif" width="500" height="282" />

If you want to follow the comedy scene in Malta, you’re best off by following some of the bigger comedy production groups that are responsible for organising stand-up nights with some of Malta’s best as well as the standout names on the international circuit. You can learn about some of these below, so you won’t miss the next chance to chuckle.

Do keep in mind that there are also plenty of comedy groups that perform in Maltese, but we won’t go into those today – this article is mostly intended for audiences who want to get their fix of comedy delivered in English.

<strong>The Comedy Knights</strong>

The Comedy Knights definitely has one of the strongest rosters of local comedians, so their events should definitely be a first point of reference if you’re interested in learning how the Maltese do comedy.

The Comedy Knights usually organise large-scale events, with a series of skits and characters to watch out for, so if you attend one of their shows you might not be in for a stand-up routine in the proper sense of the word. You’ll also definitely need to update yourself on Maltese culture, as common topics include Maltese politics and Maltese caricatures (such as stereotypical girls from Sliema).

You can also keep an eye out for any other comedy projects by any of the Comedy Knights team members, including Chris Dingli, Jo Caruana, Pia Zammit, Colin Fitz, Steve Hili, and several more.



<strong>The Eden Comedy Club</strong>

The Eden Cinema building is not just for watching films! Its multipurpose theatre makes for a great stand-up comedy venue, and the frequent events that are hosted there are always proof of this.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/standup3.gif" alt="standup3.gif" width="400" height="300" />

There are a couple of reasons why the Eden events are worth looking out for. The first is that they’re frequently held, which means that if you’re craving some comedy you probably won’t have too long to wait if you follow the Eden programme. The second is that the Eden Comedy Club usually brings a pretty eclectic mix of local and international talent. Their last event, for example, was held on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of March of this year, and featured Matt Welcome, Danny Posthill, and was hosted by Geoff Whiting.

<strong>Laugh Out Loud Productions</strong>

The LOL acronym might be a little obvious for a comedy agency group, but you do need to keep in mind that this agency has been around for ages, having started in 2004. To say that Laugh Out Loud know what they’re doing would be an understatement.

Laugh Out Loud specialising in bringing some of the top names in the UK comedy scene to Malta. Some names that have made their way to our shores thanks to this group include Men in Coats, JoJo Smith, Andrew Maxwell, Terry Anderton, Andre Vincent, and many more!

            [blog_content] => In this age of political correctness, some people might think that celebrating St Patrick’s Day in Malta is more or less cultural appropriation. It’s not a Maltese tradition by any stretch of the imagination – so why do we hit the pubs year after year?

There’s no easy way to answer this question. Well, actually that’s not quite true – the simple answer is that in Malta, just like in most countries, it’s just another excuse to down a pint. Celebrating this Irish day provides an opportunity to drink with friends, and we’ll happily take it!

On the other hand, it does lead one to wonder how many of the holidays and traditions that are now universal, or at least central to Western society, originated from one specific country or part of the world and expanded exponentially (don’t worry, folks, this is as philosophical an article on drinking is going to get from our end). So there’s that!

That being said, we’re well aware that St Patrick’s is always going to be an Irish tradition, and the Maltese definitely don’t mean to belittle anybody’s culture by joining in the festivities.  Still, a pint is a pint.

Plus (and this is a big plus), Malta has an abundance of really authentic Irish Pubs (many of them owned by people who are, you know, Irish). Considering our connection with the UK, it’s not really surprising that there’s no shortage of British bars, but this article will specifically be looking at a few of the top Irish bars in Malta to visit this Saint Patrick’s Day. Before you eagerly wear your favourite green clothes and head out on March 17<sup>th</sup>, do keep in mind that if you want to get a good spot at any of these bars, you’re going to have to think ahead!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1991" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/irish2.gif" alt="irish2.gif" width="500" height="228" />
<strong>
The Dubliner, St. Julian’s</strong>

The Dubliner is easily one of the more popular Irish pubs in Malta, and it’s easy to see why. The pub was launched in 2004, when there was a relative lack of Irish bars on the island. It would be unfair to say that The Dubliner has only made it because it was one of the first on the scene, though. This pub has the whole package, from décor, to its selection of drinks, and of course its incredible Irish pub food menu.

<strong>Ryan’s Irish Pub, St. Julian’s</strong>

Though technically an Irish Pub, Ryan’s is usually associated with crowds of partying youngsters. If you feel like getting wild this St Patrick’s day, Ryan’s is definitely the place to consider!

<strong>Cork's Irish Pub, St. Julian’s </strong>

‘How many Irish Pubs are there in St. Julian’s?’, you must be wondering. The answer is ‘plenty’.

‘Don’t they get boring?’, we hear you follow-up. The answer is ‘nope’.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/irish3.gif" alt="irish3.gif" width="480" height="270" />

Cork’s isn’t just another Irish Pub, though. Its patrons love it particularly for its frequent live music, so be on the hunt for that on the 17<sup>th</sup> of March!

<strong>The Drayton's Pub, St Julians</strong>

What’s better than an Irish Pub? How about an Irish Pub with a Billiard table?

That’s really most of what can be said about Drayton’s Pub in a nutshell, though it definitely is a fun place to be. Drink Guinness. Play pool. Go crazy.

<strong>O'Reilly's Irish Pub, Bugibba</strong>

If you want more of a sit down experience with great food to boot, but want to avoid the whole St Julian’s area, one great option is O’Reilly’s in Bugibba. Their generous portions mean that there’s no way you can scoff down their food and remain unsatisfied.

Plus, if you’re not really in the mood for beer (which is somewhat sacrilegious considering the date), you could always opt for one of their many cocktail options.

            [blog_content] => How the mighty have fallen, as they say! The Azure Window had been a national treasure for years – so it’s no wonder that its collapse has led to such dismay.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-1999 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural2.jpg" alt="natural2" width="960" height="640" />

If you’ve been living under a rock (we apologise for the pun, but it was inevitable), the Azure Window, known also as the Dwejra Window, was a natural limestone arch in Gozo, located in Dwejra Bay. It was a massive tourist attraction for numerous reasons. Apart from its natural splendour, it was also featured in numerous films and TV series, such as Clash of the Titans, The Count of Monte Cristo, Game of Thrones, The Odyssey, and more. The aura surrounding the Azure Window was definitely not overhyped.

Its collapse is definitely a sad story because everyone was expecting it – just not so soon. Parts of the top slab began to collapse between the 1980s and the 2000s, with initial sign of collapsing in 2012. Geologists who studied the arch noted that the Window would be stable for a number of years, but that its stability would be compromised if people kept getting too close. Unfortunately, they did – up until the past few days before the storm led to its collapse this March.

Sad as it is, though, there’s not much do be done about the whole thing now, though discussions regarding possible solutions and actions have already started taking place. We reckon that the best thing to do now is to invest in other existing sites in order to safeguard them better as well as promote them to people who might be as aware of them.

Indeed, the archipelago is still chockful of gorgeous natural attractions. This article will delve into a few of them so that it will be a long while before you run out of expeditions in Malta and Gozo!

<strong>The Blue Gotto</strong>

<strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2001" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural3.jpg" alt="natural3.jpg" width="718" height="539" />
</strong><strong>
</strong>Located near ‘Wied iz-Zurreq’, south of Qrendi, The Blue Grotto is the largest cave out of a group of caves in the same area. You can only reach The Blue Grotto by boat, and it definitely makes for a serene experience. Filfa is also visible from this area!

<strong>Calypso’s Cave</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2003 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural4.jpg" alt="natural4.jpg" width="576" height="396" />

This is another popular cave, but this time you’ll have to go to Gozo (specifically Xaghra) to visit, making it an even better candidate to fill the void left by the Azure Window collapse. If you’re savvy about classical literature at all, you probably don’t need us to tell you what’s special about this cave: people believe that this is the cave referred to by Homer in the iconic ‘The Odyssey’!

<strong>Ninu’s Cave</strong>
<strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2004" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural5.jpg" alt="natural5.jpg" width="587" height="405" />
</strong><em>Photo credit: www.maltaholidays.uk.com</em>
Also located in Xaghra, this cave is known for two main things – its stalagmite and stalactite formations, and even more impressive than this are the amazing views you can witness from inside the cave!

<strong>Fungus Rock</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2009" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fungus-rock.jpg" alt="Fungus Rock.jpg" width="1024" height="768" />



If you need to get even closer to the Azure Window site, you can opt to visit Fungus Rock, which is located in Dwejra too. Also known as General’s Rock, this wonder takes the form of a small islet that is 60 metres high. In the time of the Order of St. John, it was believed that a type of tuber that grows on Fungus Rock had medicinal properties. As a result, only authorised knights were legally allowed to climb it!

<strong>The Inland Sea</strong>

<strong><img class=" size-full wp-image-2007 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/natural7.jpg" alt="natural7.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

</strong>For more Dwejra goodness, check out the Inland Sea, which a saltwater lagoon that connects to the Mediterranean Sea by way of a natural tunnel arch. The tunnel is wide enough that <em>luzzijiet</em> can pass through it on calm days!

            [blog_content] => There’s no shortage of cultural activity in Malta. It doesn’t matter how many times we say it – it just never stops being true. Sometimes, there are so many events happening on a single day that it’s absolutely impossible to select a single one. This year, the 25<sup>th</sup> of March is definitely one of those days, which is why we’ve written this article to provide a comprehensive overview of all the artsy happenings that day.

So much for that lazy Saturday! How many of these activities are you going to try and squeeze in?
<strong>Evita</strong>

In Maltese, ‘Evita’ is the imperative word for ‘avoid’, but in this case we’re referring to the classic musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice! Happening at the Astra Theatre, this will actually be the first performance of Evita in Gozo.

Whether you’re new to theatre or have a deep-rooted passion for it, there’s really no reason why watching this Grammy-winning classic is a bad idea – even if it’s just to belt out ‘Don’t Cry for Me, Argentina!’

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2014" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/arts2.gif" alt="arts2.gif" width="260" height="144" />



<strong>Gospel Music Concert - Two Choirs</strong>

Looking for a unique musical experience? How about a collaboration between an Irish Gospel Choir and a Maltese one?

The Lucan Gospel Choir from Dublin will be coming to Malta after 10 years, having first visited in 2007. They will be pairing up with Joy Gospel Singers from Malta to deliver a fantastic aural spectacle. This event is happening for free at the St Lawrence Church in Birgu and is supported by the Irish Embassy in Malta.
<strong>Roger’s Floyd in Malta</strong>

If Gospel music isn’t quite your thing, there’s a chance that rock music might be. Specifically, rock music from one of the greatest bands in the world – Pink Floyd.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2015" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/arts3.gif" alt="arts3.gif" width="474" height="356" />

All things considered, watching Pink Floyd live is a bit of an improbability, though, and much less in Malta. Thanks to high quality tribute bands, though, the spirit of Pink Floyd lives on, and Roger’s Floyd is giving you the opportunity to partake in that spirit at the Orpheum Theatre in Gzira. This is no small deal – Roger’s Floyd is one of the top Pink Floyd Tribute bands in the UK. Are you getting comfortably numb with excitement?
<strong>Colours in Motion</strong>

A project inspired by Malta’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, Colours in Motion is an architectural projection piece that will be showcased at the Grandmaster’s Palace in Valletta. The projections follow the narrative of a young girl exploring the three major themes of Malta’s EU presidency, including migration, maritime and Mediterranean. The setting of the world portrayed in the projections is inspired by iconic European paintings.

Specifically, though, the Colours in Motion project is a celebration of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which led to the eventual creation of the European Union.

An original score, written by Reuben Zahra, has been written to accompany the project.

<strong>Annual Scale Model Exhibition</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2017" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/arts4.gif" alt="arts4.gif" width="480" height="366" />

This one is definitely more niche-oriented than the other events, but we’re sure it’s bound to appeal to some people nonetheless. If you’re into scale models portraying era-specific vehicles and other items, then this is definitely the event for you. Taking place at the Catholic Insitute in Floriana, the Annual Scale Model Exhibition is a great way to relax and focus on the finer details…of scale models.

            [blog_content] => The Maltese sure know how to pack a lot of architecture into one small archipelago. You’ll have noticed this with how there seems to be churches everywhere. However, the same is true of our theatres. We have a very vibrant theatre culture in Malta, with no shortage of performances of international and local productions. It’s only fitting that there would be ample spaces that accommodate this continuous drive towards the Arts. What’s more is that theatres here are often used for multiple purposes.

Although the question here really needs to our take on an old cliché: what came first, the theatres, or the theatre culture? It’s a little bit more complicated than that – but maybe you can come with your own answer as you go through this list of some of the most popular and gorgeous theatres in Malta.

<strong>The Manoel Theatre, Valletta</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2025 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre2.jpg" alt="theatre2" width="649" height="347" />

An obligatory mention, the Manoel Theatre in Valletta is Malta’s national theatre, and the oldest functioning theatre in all of Europe. This theatre was built in 1731 by Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena, as a way of creating a proper space for shows and what he called ‘honest entertainment’. Before this, they were housed at the Knight’s Auberges, or in public spaces.

<strong>Astra Theatre, Victoria</strong>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2033 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/opera.jpg" alt="Opera" width="1200" height="766" />
One of the main theatres in Victoria, this Gozitan theatre is mostly known for its extensive display of opera and musicals, but is by no means limited to just these genres. Since its inception in 1968, the Astra Theatre has hosted world-class singers such as Pamela Kucenic, Adeilaide Negri, Giuseppe Giacomini, and of course Malta’s own Joseph Calleja.
<strong>St James Cavalier, Valletta</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2026" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre4.jpg" alt="theatre4.jpg" width="492" height="290" />

Not so much a sole theatre so much as it is a ‘centre for creativity’, St James Cavalier is one of Malta’s top spaces for any kind of event from theatre productions, art exhibitions, music concerts, workshops, film showings, and more. The best news is that there’s always a packed calendar full of exciting events to appeal to any culture enthusiast.
<strong>The MITP Theatre, Valletta</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2027" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre5.jpg" alt="theatre5.jpg" width="864" height="576" />
Photo credit: www.hairyampmalta.com
This is considerably more contemporary theatre, in the sense that the MITP theatre is a ‘black box’ venue of sorts that is malleable in its function and has been used for theatre as well as music concerts and dance events. The MITP Theatre is located at the Old University Campus, so it’s not surprising that you’ll find everything here from the provocative to the sophisticated.

<strong>Masquerade/M Space, Imsida</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2028" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre6.jpg" alt="theatre6.jpg" width="320" height="320" />

Masquerade is an educational space as much as it is a performative one. With plenty of arts education programmes (ranging from theatre, dance and music), you might find yourself reaching out to Masquerade should you ever want to participate in the arts more directly.

Masquerade has been active since 1997, but in 2012 a new 7-storey building – M Space – was launched, in order to provide even better facilities and even more interesting performing spaces.

<strong>The Salesian Theatre, Sliema</strong>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2029" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/theatre7.jpg" alt="theatre7.jpg" width="2074" height="1382" />

The Salesian Theatre in Sliema has been in operation since 1908, and has long since been established as a prime theatre outlet in Malta. The team behind the theatre often invite performers to the stage, and also organise productions within its Salesian community, which is a Christian life community that seeks to inspire youth with artistic creation as a constant drive.

The Royal Opera House in Valletta is a particularly special theatre because it was built on the ruins of the former Opera House, which was ruined in World War II. Only inaugurated in 2013, this open air theatre is now one of the most gorgeous spaces you can hope to see a production at, especially during warmer months. The Royal Opera House has hosted everything from music festivals, to King Lear productions, and all else in between.

<strong>The Mediterranean Conference Centre, Valletta</strong>

The building in the Valletta that is now the MCC began life all the way back in 1574 as a ward during the time of the Order of the Knights of St. John. After literally centuries of changing uses and refurbishments, the MCC found a new voice as a multipurpose building that is used for theatrical events, concerts, exhibitions, conferences (of course) and so much more.

            [blog_content] => It’s that time of the year when the Passion is back in fashion. For Catholics in Malta and around the world, it’s a time of remembrance, solitude, contemplation, and ultimately celebration. However, it’s also a time in which devotees can show tribute to the biblical event by participating in plays and pageants.

This year, just like every other year, Malta is the place to be if you want to experience productions relating to the Easter story, and you’re bound to find a production that suits your interests whether you’re looking for a faithful retelling, or an interpretation.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2059 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/easter-4.jpg" alt="easter 4.jpg" width="1020" height="714" />

This article will provide a comprehensive overview of many of the Easter productions happening in Malta this year.

<strong>Jesus Christ Superstar
</strong>A now classic and a unanimous favourite, it’s hard to not get excited over a performance of <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>. Taking place at the Catholic Institute in Floriana on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> of April, this rendition of the Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice work features some top names in Malta as well as a live, 12-piece orchestra.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2060 alignright" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/easter-2.jpg" alt="easter 2.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" />

<strong>Live Last Supper</strong>

Happening in Mqabba, in the Subterranean Camber of Palazz Santa Marija in the church square, between the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> of April (though not every day) this last supper is set to provide an interesting take on Judas’ role in the whole story, with the pivotal question asked being whether Judas was a traitor, or in fact betrayed himself.

<strong>Iesus</strong>

The Senglea drama group is known for putting on spectacular dramas on an annual basis during Holy Week. This year is no exception as their new play, Iesus, will be performed at Sede Azzjoni Kattolika in Senglea on the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> of April.

<strong>Rajt.Smajt.Qtilt</strong>

Rajt.Smajt.Qtilt (I saw.I heard.I killed) might be an odd choice of name for an Easter show, much more so for one that is happening in Birzebbuga’s Primary School Hall. However, it’s definitely a guarantee that this will be one of the more intriguing takes on the Passion story. In fact, Rajt.Smajt.Qtilt is apparently a more modern interpretation overall. Unfortunately, we doubt that people who don’t know Maltese will be able to follow.
<strong>Calix Amaritudinis</strong>

This is another production that is set to add a fresh look on the story of Jesus Christ. Calix Amaritudinis focuses specifically on an abduction plot crafted by the priests in an attempt to thwart Christ. Judas is, of course, a key character here. The fact that a World War II shelter in Qormi is being readapted for this play is a cool plus!<strong>
</strong>
<strong>Handel’s Messiah</strong>

Although this is not a play, we have to mention this performance by the Goldberg Ensemble of Handel’s timeless classic, The Messiah. Happening at St Paul’s Anglican Pro-Cathedral in Valletta on the 16<sup>th</sup> of April, you can expect a rather faithful interpretation of the work as Handel himself intended, with single strings and few singers.

<strong>Jesus Christ Superstar Shelter Show</strong>

4Teenth Productions will produce for the third and last time highlights from the musical ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’; a rock opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. This musical depicts the last few hours of Jesus Christ as seen through the eyes of Judas Iscariot. This year the production will be totally different to what was presented in the past two years. The show will include different musical tracks and an innovative take on stage direction. Jesus Christ Superstar Shelter Show will be held on the 12th amp; 13th April (shows starting at 8pm, 9pm, 10pm and 11pm) and on Friday 14<sup>th</sup> April (shows starting at 9am, 10am, 11am and noon).

            [blog_content] => With the first of April just around the corner, it’s time for something a little bit more light-hearted on our end. We wouldn’t say that Malta has a very strong April Fool’s culture here, although if you’ve been here enough you’ll know that the Maltese have a very specific brand of humour that’s witty and generally somewhat naughty. You’ll also know we’re always up for a good laugh and don’t need any reason to whip out the metaphorical joke book, so pranks do often go down a treat here, too.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2090" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-6.gif" alt="prank 6.gif" width="500" height="500" />

Whether you’re Maltese-born and raised, or if this is your first time on the island, you might be looking for a few Malta-specific pranks to play on your friends, family, or loved ones. That’s where we come in, as we’ve thought of a few simple practical jokes that we reckon should work pretty well. Don’t share this article before you’ve tested a few out, or your victims will catch on!

<strong>The Nasty Pastizzi Prank</strong>

There’s only one thing that’s better than a pastizz, and that’s a free pastizz. That means that if you offer a pastizz to anyone, it’s almost impossible to find someone who will refuse. Even the initial hesitations of ‘<em>le ta</em><strong>, </strong>I’m on a diet’ can be thwarted by the irresistible fumes of flaky goodness.

The premise of this prank is simple – buy (or make) a few ricotta pastizzi…and hide a large glob of toothpaste in the filling. The first few bites of heaven will quickly lead into a something a lot more hellish. <strong>
</strong>
<strong>The Weather Prank</strong>

If you’ve lived in Malta for longer than five minutes, you probably know how temperamental Malta’s weather is. The only constant seems to be in summer, when the weather ranges from ‘hot’ to ‘unbearably scorching’. Every other season is a bit of a moody mess, and since April Fool’s happens in Spring, you have the opportunity to use the weather to your advantage for a few laughs.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2091" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-7.gif" alt="prank 7.gif" width="800" height="600" />

This one is super simple – all you need to do is tell a friend (who won’t have gotten out of bed yet) what the weather is like that day, but of course you’d be describing the exact opposite of what the weather will actually be like. Your friend will likely dress up for the day all wrong, and have to change his outfit again before he really leaves the house.

<strong>The ‘It’s a Public Holiday’ Prank</strong>

That Malta has an overabundance of public holidays is a well-known fact. We have so many public holidays that we can barely keep up with them all, but nobody who’s even slightly hedonistic is going to pass up the chance to take it easy all day.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2069" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-4.gif" alt="prank 4.gif" width="300" height="167" />

That means you might manage to convince someone – Maltese or not – that the 1<sup>st</sup> of April is actually a public holiday. Make up a saint or fake World War II period celebration – it’s your call.

This year, April Fool’s is happening on a Saturday. This makes your job somewhat easier because most people won’t be working anyway. On the downside, you probably won’t be convincing anyone that they don’t need to go to work, but you might be able to rouse some patriotic sentiments that you can poke fun at later when you explain that there is no such public holiday.

<strong>The –Insert Monument Here- Has Collapsed Prank</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/prank-5.gif" alt="prank 5.gif" width="250" height="266" />

This one is probably a little mean-spirited considering that people are still feeling the loss of the Azure Window, but that’s all the more reason for it to work. Pick one of Malta’s monuments. It can be a natural monument (we have a whole article on these), or even one of Malta’s megalithic temples (we have an article on these, too!) and convince a friend that it’s collapsed, you’ll be an April Fool’s King. Don’t let anyone mourn for too long, though!
<strong>The ‘I’m Staying in Malta Forever’ Prank</strong>

If you’re only meant to be living in Malta for a few days, weeks, or months, you can always give your family a scare by telling them you love it so much here that you’re going to stay here forever. You can make the story even more elaborate by mentioning that you’ve met the love of your life, or that you think the living conditions are too good to get away from.

We reckon it would be very easy for this prank to succeed, too. After all, who wouldn’t want to live in Malta forever?

            [blog_content] => Festival names are a curious affair. Some festivals have almost entirely cryptic names that delight the imagination, and could leave you guessing what the nature of the event is for hours unless you simply decide to look up more information. The Craft Beer amp; Live Music Festival is not one of those festivals.

That’s not to say it’s going to be a bland festival, because it clearly is not. Happening between the 7<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> of April, in what was once one of the most notorious areas in Valletta’s history, the Gut (has the meaning been re-appropriated to represent the Beer Gut?), the festival is the perfect combination of the elements that make a great night out.

Still not convinced that the Craft Beer amp; Live Music Festival isn’t worth your time? Allow us to try and get you on board in this article.

<strong>The Craft Beer</strong>

As far as beer in Malta is concerned, Cisk is the main religion. This is indisputable. There’s not a single person alive in Malta who is not aware of this iconic beverage. Yet, although Cisk will always be a staple part of the Maltese diet, craft beers are all the rage lately. You don’t even need to be a moustache twirling hipster to partake in the hype.



<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/craft-4.gif" alt="craft 4.gif" width="422" height="238" />



Although somewhat pricey, the taste of a good craft beer in unmatchable and there’s so much variety that it’s impossible to not find something that suits your taste buds perfectly.
In Malta, passion for craft beers has been brewing for quite a few years, and now we have a few companies such as Stretta and Lord Chambray that put out refined beers for refined gentlemen (or anyone into beer, really).


<img class=" size-full wp-image-2078 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/craft-2.jpg" alt="craft 2" width="960" height="509" /><em>Photo credit: Stretta Craft Beer</em>
The craft beer part of this festival is organised by Stretta, which is a really new brewery, having only launched last year. In fact, it only has one craft beer currently out, although a few other types are in the works. The current Stretta beer is an India Pale Ale which is slightly fruity but not to the detriment of the distinct, malty taste. It’s a delight, and packs quite the punch on the alcohol side of things, too.

We recommend that everyone gives Stretta a try at the festival, but that’s not the only craft beer on offer. Indeed, there will be over 30 types from breweries all around the world.

<strong>The Live Music</strong>

<strong>

</strong>
The other part of the festival, i.e. the location handling and music, is being handled by Offbeat, which is a music bar entity opening later this year. Offbeat is already proving itself as a force to be reckoned with by selecting some of the most exciting acts right now, such as KażinSka, a group that plays ska versions of band marches; Swing Nuages, which is probably the finest band playing gypsy jazz in Malta; and YEWS, who is one of the most dynamic and unique solo artists on the island. Of course, we can’t not mention the equally great Tony Camilleri, Nadine Axisa, and Hot Club of Valletta.

<strong> </strong><strong>The Location</strong>

The festival is taking place at the McKay Bar in the Strada Stretta area, and any history nut will know that this is actually kind of historical. Also known as the Silver Horse, the McKay bar hasn’t been open in 50 years. As a Strada Stretta bar, it was one of the main hotspots for English sailors back in the day, meaning that it was the site of much rowdiness and debauchery. Cabaret shows, transvestitism (back then a big deal), and all sorts of similar acts could be found at the Silver Horse. You probably won’t find much of the same during the festival, though.

            [blog_content] => Horses are a very big part of Maltese culture. Sometimes our relationship with horses meets a few raised eyebrows by the international community, especially since Malta is one of the countries that finds eating horse meat acceptable (but this is not the space for that ethical debate).

Ultimately, the truth is that the Maltese love their fellow neigh-bours (we take no responsibility for any groaning incurred through this pun). If you want to get in on the horse-love, horse riding is an excellent place to start, and it’s a pretty common activity in Malta that is enjoyed by kids and adults alike.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2100 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/horse-2.jpg" alt="horse 2.jpg" width="960" height="720" />
<em>Photo credit: Golden Bay Horse Riding</em>
Why opt for horse riding, though? Isn’t it better to simply admire horses without climbing on top of them and having them trot with your added weight?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2102 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/horse-4.gif" alt="horse 4" width="450" height="253" />

The truth is that horse riding is an activity that, when done right, can benefit both the horse and the rider. Think about our relationship with dogs – a relationship built across millennia that makes our canine connection special. Our relationship with horses is very similar, in the sense that humans have ridden horses since the two species existed in the same evolutionary period. When horses are treated with kindness, riding them can make for a very connected experience.

Don’t take our word for it, though. Experts have provided much insight as to how and why horse riding can be beneficial to both the horse and the person riding it. On a personal level, horse riding promotes skills that involve coordination, balance, timing and rhythm. It also provides mental and physical relaxation and so works as a means of de-stressing while also boosting your physical abilities.

The same benefits are observable in the horses, so while you might feel that riding beloved equestrians might be oppressive, the truth is that when done right they will become happier mentally and physically.

The question, of course, now is where to get your horse riding fix in Malta. We’ll happily direct you to Golden Bay Horse Riding, a horse riding service provider in the Mellieha area that been active since 1981. With 32 years of experience you can bet that Golden Bay Horse Riding is fully equipped to help you trot with ease. Indeed, the company has come a long way since its first year, when siblings Beverley and Mario Frendo only had a 4-horse stable.

Golden Bay Horse Riding take great pride in the care of their horses. They’re not kept in the sun, and never let them carry a weight that exceeds 95 kilos.

There are lots of options at Golden Bay Horse Riding, including hour long rides as well as sunset rides – and all of this is offered at very reasonable prices. You don’t even need to leave the kids behind, as anyone aged 5 onwards is welcome to participate. Do note, though, that booking has to be made 2 days prior to the ride. This gives you plenty of opportunity to plan out the rest of the day – you can go for a swim at the Golden Bay beach after, or grab a drink from one of the numerous nearby cafés.

            [blog_content] => If you’ve been following our blog for a while, you’ll know that there’s no shortage of places to work out at in Malta if you’re into gyms. Yet the fitness possibilities in Malta don’t end there. From weights, to all kinds of sports, to martial arts and more, you can rest assured that you’ll find the right place for you to break a sweat in.

If you’re into yoga, the same is also true. For the uninitiated, yoga is an excellent practice to introduce to your daily routine. More than simply exercise, yoga is an excellent way of regulating your breathing, strengthening your core, and also focusing yourself mentally through meditation. It really is an all-in-one package.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2110" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/sup-4.gif" alt="sup 4.gif" width="500" height="396" />

If you’re looking for the best Yoga workout in Malta, your first instinct might be to look for the best yoga studio around – but why limit yourself to an indoors setting? Malta is home to some of the most relaxing and beautiful natural beauty in the world, so surely practicing a relaxing art like yoga in nature is the best logical step.

Enter SUP Yoga, a yoga programme that combines traditional yoga with Stand-up Paddleboards. Picture that – balancing on a paddleboard in the middle of the clear blue sea while trying to reach positions that you’ve never reached before. Does that sound relaxing, or intimidating?

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2112 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/sup-2.jpg" alt="sup 2" width="961" height="641" />

The truth is that SUP Yoga is very similar to all other forms of yoga, in the sense that anyone can do it with a little bit of practice, so any worries about it being too difficult should be quashed, even if SUP Yoga is slightly harder than ordinary yoga. In fact, SUP Yoga has grown considerably in popularity since being introduced to Malta in 2011, and that should be proof enough that anyone can partake if they want to.

SUP Yoga isn’t just ordinary in the yoga in the sea, though. It has specific benefits that you won’t necessarily get with regular yoga. The most obvious one is that SUP Yoga works even better than regular yoga as a workout, because you need to focus more on your technique and overall balance in order to practise it. Even though SUP Yoga is harmless (even if you fall), there’s an added adrenaline that will keep you on your toes a little bit more, and this will lead to bigger and better results. That means that your breathing will be improved and your core will become stronger through SUP Yoga than through normal yoga.

In addition to all of that, the outdoors aspect of SUP Yoga provides the perfect opportunity for you to connect with nature and connect with yourself. Something that is as physically, mentally, and spiritually fulfilling as yoga shouldn’t be confined to a sweaty room!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2114" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/sup-3.jpg" alt="sup 3.jpg" width="1400" height="452" />
How do you book your first SUP Yoga session? That’s the easiest part – all you have to do is head over to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/sup-yoga">https://www.funmalta.com/sup-yoga</a> and book directly through our website. Sessions are held at St George’s Bay, St Julian’s, or Mellieha Bay, giving you a great opportunity to sample a wide range of Maltese beauty while you’re focusing on your yoga technique.

            [blog_content] => We realise that over the past few months we’ve written quite a bit about music concerts and larger-scale festivals. We’re sure you get the message: there’s a lot of music happening in Malta. <em>Can we get back to the nature and history, please?</em>, you might be asking.

Rock the South isn’t just any festival, though. Now in its 6<sup>th</sup> edition, the event is somewhat historical in itself for its varied display of local and foreign acts, and it’s definitely very much anticipated by hundreds of music fans all over the island. It’s also a pretty significant event because it’s set in Marsascala. Most events we rave about happen in Valletta, Sliema, or similar areas – so we’re really stoked to promote this hub of culture in a completely different part of the island.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockthesouthmt/videos/1842282996011595/">https://www.facebook.com/rockthesouthmt/videos/1842282996011595/</a>

Taking place at Zion, Rock the South will be spread over three days, starting on the 21<sup>st</sup> of April (Friday) and ending on the 23<sup>rd</sup> (Sunday). Despite the name, there are acts on bill here that transcend rock music, though you can bet that the promise of distorted noise will be fulfilled.

Rock the South is the brainchild of Nick Morales, who works tirelessly year after year to make the event possible, while collaborating with some of the biggest entities in local music. This was first year in which the event partly assisted through a crowdfunding scheme, which we think is amazing as it really helps the communitarian aspect of the whole thing to shine through.

You can either opt for a weekend block ticket or individual day tickets. Tickets for Friday and Saturday cost €12, while the Sunday tickets are €15. The block ticket is just €30. What does that get you? Lots of live music, of course! Every day there will be two stages running parallel to each other (and no acts clash, which is great). You’ll also be treated to a nightly Silent Disco, which has been a staple of the Rock the South programme for many years now. This is exactly what it sounds like – a disco where you put on headphones and hear everything through them. It sounds quite surreal, and it is!

Let’s get to the live music line up though, because that’s definitely the heart of the whole festival. What can you expect on each day?

<strong>Friday 21<sup>st</sup> April</strong>

The first day of Rock the South sets the mood with a punky and charged bill of bands, including CEERA, Cryptic Street, Dusk, WakaTa, NAANGS, and headliners Beesqueeze.

It’s not all aggressive stuff, though. Also performing on Friday is Lois, a Spanish solo artist who promises a dreamier sounding set for anyone looking for vibes that are a little bit chiller.

<strong>Saturday 22<sup>nd</sup> April</strong>

If you think modern music is too full of singers that just don’t know when to shut up, you’re in luck as an instrumental stage in being set up featuring some of Malta’s most eclectic bands, such as Super Sponge Trio, Kingdoms of Dusk, and The Ranch. Headlining will be Sdang!, an Italian group that has already performed at Rock the South Twice. For the first time, the duo as a trio in Malta, as they’ve employed bassist Colin Edwin from the legendary Porcupine Tree!

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sdangband/videos/1952462771656206/">https://www.facebook.com/sdangband/videos/1952462771656206/</a>

If you’re more interested in bouncy, poppy tunes you’re in luck as the other stage features bands with a penchant for catchy songwriting, including Massacre House Party, Canvas Wall, and nosnow/noalps.

<strong>Sunday 23<sup>rd</sup> April</strong>

The final day at Rock the South is also the longest. While the previous two days begin at 6.30 pm, Sunday kicks off at 3 pm, so you don’t need to worry about how to spend the day before heading down to Zion! Afternoon sessions will be provided by Lucy’s Last, EXPLICIT, Jack’s Fusion, The Voyage, and Jeper Ejrup + Nick Jones.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-LEGQCHYDQ

The two evening stages once again will focus on diversity as one is geared towards more aggressive acts including BILA, Double Standard, Rage Against Society, Norm Rejection, Kill the Action, and LVX. The other stage will feature more experimental and melancholic acts including Oxygn, Eyes to Argus, CRUX, and YEWS.

            [blog_content] => The Segway has been around since 2001, even though it feels like a very new invention Perhaps that’s because Segways were never a huge trend in Malta – though you would find them in the streets here and there you could never exactly find hundreds of people travelling around on them at a go. Which really begs the question: what make a Segway Tour an appealing in 2017?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2124" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/segway-2.gif" alt="segway 2.gif" width="700" height="394" />

The truth is that Segways have a lot of potential for touring purposes that is only beginning to be untapped now, at least in Malta. The advantages are undeniable. Take the fact, for example, that Segways aren’t particularly fast, reaching a max speed of 12 miles an hour.  ‘Wait’, you might be wondering. ‘How is that an advantage?’ Let’s put it this way – it forces you to appreciate your surroundings. In addition to this, Segways are safe and easy to operate, which means that you can direct even more attention to everything that’s happening around (though always check where you’re heading!).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2126" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/segway-3.gif" alt="segway 3.gif" width="384" height="288" />

The Segway is built to withstand multiple terrains, which makes them very versatile as a means of getting around Malta. It’s also a rather family friendly form of travelling, although only children aged 12 and upwards are allowed to join Segway tours in Malta.

With all this in mind, how do you join your first Segway tour in Malta?

Enter Malta Segway Tours, a company intent on helping people see the sights Malta has to offer in an innovative and creative way. So far there are only two main tour areas available through this company – Valletta and Dingli – but there are plenty of plans to expand. In the meantime, you can choose to enjoy the architectural and historical beauty of Valletta, or the natural beauty of Dingli and its cliffs.

The Valletta tour, as you’d expect, covers a lot of historical insight into what makes Valletta the wonder that it is. The tour lasts an hour and a half, and you can then opt to visit The Malta Experience show that lasts another 45 minutes. The package costs a very reasonable €55 per person.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2128" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/segway-4.gif" alt="segway 4.gif" width="359" height="202" />
There are actually two Dingli tours that you can opt for. One is a ‘Funtastic’ tour that takes you through the traditional village of Dingli and ends at the breath-taking Buskett Gardens, while the ‘Adventure’ tour is much more nature-centric, so gliding through the cliffy area and other natural locations in Dingli is what you can expect here. The tours cost €49 and €79, respectively. The Funtastic tour lasts an hour and forty-five minutes, while the Adventure tour lasts three hours. You’d definitely be getting your money’s worth!

If you’re eager to join the fun and ride into your first Segway tour experience, all you need to do is book through the following page: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours">https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours</a>.

            [blog_content] => One wonderful thing about Malta is that despite our size, all sports get love in one way or another. Even though football fans yell the loudest – or rather, they yell in the highest numbers – rugby is an incredibly close second in terms of popularity. Some people make the argument that as far as how Malta fares internationally, rugby actually surpasses football by a wide margin, but we won’t get into that here!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rugby-3.gif" alt="rugby 3.gif" width="500" height="232" />

What is not up for debate though is how exciting Maltese rugby is. It’s more than the loyal fan-base. Malta’s national rugby team is really quite formidable and has great potential to become even stronger. The team’s nickname is The Rams (L-Imtaten) which is a sure reflection of this strength.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2136 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rugby-2.jpg" alt="rugby 2.jpg" width="259" height="273" />

If you didn’t know that fact, odds are there are plenty more you’re not aware of. That’s why this article is all about putting Maltese rugby in the limelight it deserves to be in! Read on for more facts about the sport in Malta:

<strong>Rugby was brought into Malta by the British</strong>

Perhaps this is a somewhat predictable fact in hindsight, but it’s always intriguing to see how the British influenced Malta in almost every imaginable way! The first rugby club in Malta was set up in 1946 called the Overseas Rugby Club and was mostly made up of British servicemen.

However, rugby didn’t really gain much of a following until the 1970s, when a few schools began teaching the game to students. Despite this, one could find the first influx of local clubs at the beginning of the 1990s, thanks to the revival of the Overseas Rugby Club and the establishing of clubs such as the Kavallieri, the Stompers, and the University Rugby Football Club (now known as Alligator RFC). Nowadays there are plenty of other local clubs.

<strong>The Malta National Rugby Union Team is relatively new
</strong>
Malta’s national rugby team played its first match in 2000, against Moldova. That’s 17 years ago, which is a long time if you’re a human being, but not so much if you’re an international sports club.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2138 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rugby-4.gif" alt="rugby 4.gif" width="294" height="233" />

It’s also pretty safe to say that Malta started out as underdogs. We lost our first match 58-8, and lost our second match against Belgium in the same year with a score of 26-0. However, Malta would go on to secure its first win against Monaco the following year.

<strong>Maltese Rugby has seen considerable success</strong>

Malta is currently ranked 42<sup>nd</sup> in the World Rugby world rankings, which is not too shabby at all! Although Malta has never qualified for the Rugby World Cup, in 2007 we did enter the qualification tournament and made it to Pool B of the third round.

Malta currently competes in the European Division 2A and in the 2013-14 season finished 2<sup>nd</sup> to the Netherlands.
<strong>
Malta is Playing this Saturday at the Hibernian’s Stadium
</strong>
Malta will be taking on Israel on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of April! Whether you’ve never watched a rugby match in Malta, or whether you’re a diehard fan, this an excellent opportunity to witness one of the things that Malta does best.

            [blog_content] => Not many people might accept an invitation to go abseiling right away, especially if they’ve never attempted the sport before. You can’t really blame them – descending a rock face with the use of rope can be terrifying. That is, until you learn how safe it is when done properly.

Abseiling is not as dangerous as you might initially think. Many people learn how to abseil as children and it also requires less equipment than regular climbing activities. That being said, abseiling should always be done as a controlled climb with people overseeing you, and only the sturdiest equipment and top protection measures should be utilised.

There are plenty of reasons why abseiling is worth your time. Considered to be an adventure sport or an extreme sport, there’s very little else that can provide the sure rush and adrenaline that abseiling does. It’s a rush that everybody should feel a few times in their life! In fact, we’d go as far as to say that such adrenaline is really healthy. Abseiling teaches you that taking risks; that making that first push is a liberating step. Abseiling teaches you to forego your inhibitions.



<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2144" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/abseiling-2.gif" alt="abseiling 2.gif" width="528" height="297" />



Plus, abseiling is a legitimate sport, in that it requires physical effort and mental focus. It’s definitely a way of burning the calories, and though we doubt it will become a daily part of your efforts to keep fit, it’s a great way of changing up the pace.

Perhaps the most wonderful part about abseiling, though is that you become immersed in your surroundings. Nothing is more beautiful than climbing down a rock face knowing that you are part of that whole structure, while breathing in the fresh air and the scents of nature around you.

That’s why Malta is an amazing place to abseil in! With so many beautiful landscapes everywhere, it’s hard not to get the impulse to climb down them! From Bahrija to Xlendi and countless other areas, if you’re an abseiling nut you’ll likely never run out of places to practise at. If you do, you can always revisit some of the same ones – they never stop being gorgeous!

Of course, as we’ve already stressed, abseiling should be conducted as a group activity, with professionals overseeing you, especially if you’re a newbie or simply don’t have years of experience under your belt. The best way to start your venture in abseiling adventures is through Fun Malta, whose collaboration with MC Adventure guarantees access to some of the most exciting spots for the sport.

Being very flexible they can cater to both small and large groups and will organise routes based on the overall skill and experience level present. You can start off with shorter routes and build your way to something a bit more daring. The longest abseil route available is over 75m, but of course beginners will not start here! There are only a few unique abseiling spots on offer, including an urban bridge in Mosta.

            [blog_content] => If you’ve been following our blog recently, you might have noticed that we’re really putting an effort into providing different ways of immersing yourself in the beauty that is our natural Maltese landscape. Malta has such an endless supply of nature that we can’t imagine anyone getting tired of it, but it’s precisely because Malta’s beauty is so tireless that finding new ways of exploring it is the ultimate way of appreciating it.

Kayaking is just one of the ways that you can become one with the archipelago, but what a way it is.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2157" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kayak-1.gif" alt="kayak 1.gif" width="480" height="360" />

Of course, if you want to travel around Malta’s sea, the options are practically limitless. Why opt for a kayak? We like to think of kayaking as a best-of-all-worlds kind of vessel. By that we mean that you get all the serenity that comes with being on a boat (perhaps even more so because there are no noisy engines) and you also get a serious workout in the process, especially with regard to your upper body. We know that exercise is not on everyone’s minds when it comes to these things, but it’s always worth mentioning!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2158" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kayak-2.gif" alt="kayak 2.gif" width="350" height="192" />

Kayaking is also great for another reason that is definitely underrated, which is that kayaks are better for the fish in the sea than most other kinds of sea vessels. Because kayaks are so stealthy and smooth in design, the fish will not even notice your presence. We do understand that some people do opt to go fishing on kayaks, but that’s another (umm) kettle of fish entirely.

Have we convinced you that kayaking is a wonderful activity to try in Malta? Great! The question that remains is how to get started. Fortunately, the answer is even easier than the question! All you have to do is make a booking through Fun Malta!

Fun Malta is a booking agent for MC Adventure, a group of adventure-driven professionals that can organise kayaking activities you’ll never forget. Perfect for small or large groups, there are a multitude of options available when looking into your next kayaking trip. You can even opt for a half-day activity or a full-day one!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2159" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kayak-3.gif" alt="kayak 3.gif" width="480" height="360" />

For the (understandably) safety-conscious: thanks to the experts at MC Adventure accompanying you every step of the way, there’s no need for worry as you’ll get all the help you need. That means beginners are more than welcome to join in on the fun.

The best part of course is that there are multiple spots that are suitable for kayaking and this is reflected in the range of tours on offer. One of the most popular ones include a kayaking adventure to Comino, which is full of natural arches and caves. Another takes you to the delightfully underrated area of Selmun Bay and the St Paul’s Islands (also known as Selmunett)!

                )

            [blog_content] => The suggestion of renting of car when spending time in Malta might seem a little odd. After all, everyone knows our island is tiny, and in addition to that fact we even have a pretty efficient bus service that can take you anywhere you need to go. Renting a car seems unnecessary, right?

Not quite. Despite the fact that people certainly do get by using our public transport system as well as taxis when needed, driving is still the number one transport method of choice in Malta and there are plenty of reasons for that.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2164" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rental-1.gif" alt="rental 1.gif" width="400" height="225" />

We’re not implying that using a car is the only way to get by, and if you’re only going to visit the islands for a week or so it might definitely be worth your while to make do without one. Using a bus comes with its own advantages too – if you’re getting used to Malta it can be great to simply gaze at your surroundings through the window without having to worry about the road.

However, for anyone staying a bit longer, car rental should definitely be a consideration. Here’s why:

<b>Trips are usually shorter</b>

Although you will hear some inevitable stories of late buses, they are usually punctual. However, a bus ride can be lengthened for a few reasons, including the bus driver having to stop every few minutes to pick up more passengers. You might also find that to get to certain destinations you’ll have to catch two buses, which can increase the waiting and journey time quite a bit. With a rental car you can go straight to your destination without having to make extra stops.
<b>You can travel when you like</b>

This point comes in two parts. When you choose to catch the bus, you of course need to stick to the schedule, and when you catch a taxi you need to wait for it to arrive.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2166" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/rental-2.gif" alt="rental 2.gif" width="480" height="270" />

The other issue is that night buses are somewhat limited in Malta, so you will have to pay attention to your watch to make sure you’re going to catch the last one. Alternatively, you could again opt for the taxi, but it seems like an unnecessary expense when you could just drive home when you likeoutwithout having to plan u a schedule.
<b>
You can take spontaneous detours</b>

What happens if you’re on the bus and you suddenly decide you want to change plans? You’d have to get off, figure out your new route, and waste a lot of time.

With a rental car, all you need is punch your new location in your GPS and you’ll be good to go!

<b>Rental cars allow you to budget better
</b>
Though renting a car is likely going to be as expensive or even more expensive than making use of alternative transport options, the fact that you’ll have the payment laid down means that you can plan the rest of your budget around it. Taxi costs accumulate, which means that you might end up less willing to splurge because you won’t be quite sure of how much money is going into transport on any particular day.

<b>You can battle Malta’s temperamental weather</b>

It’s no secret that the weather in Malta does what it likes when it likes. Why wait for a bus in the boiling sun or pouring rain when you can travel with a car roof over your head and AC/heater options at the ready?

            [blog_content] => <span style="color:#353535;">‘<span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Blood, sweat, and tears’. This phrase, coined by Sir Winston Churchill, is now associated with hard work of any kind, and we think that it’s absolutely appropriate when talking about The Grid, Malta’s most challenging obstacle race ever. We’d love to tell you that Grid participants can bypass the blood and tears component of it all, and only have ample amounts of sweat in their future, but we’re that’s not exactly true. </span></span></span>

<span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">You see, gearing up for The Grid takes effort, and lots of it. You need to be really physically fit if you want to hold your own against the rest.

How much exercise can you do in a month? It’s time to find out!</span></span></span>

<span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">We’re not trying to make signing up for The Grid sound too masochistic. All challenges of this calibre are going to be tough, and as goes the cliché, there is great reward in such dedication, so we genuinely think this is a great opportunity for anyone over the age of 16 and physically fit enough to give it a shot.</span></span></span>

<a name="_GoBack"></a> <span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Despite the name that The Grid has already made for itself, this is only the second year that the annual event has been around, with the first iteration taking place in May of last year. This June, one can look forward to a lot of similarity from the previous year, as the event will be held on the same 15km Armed Forces Assault course in Pembroke. Can you think of a course with a more fitting name? We sure can’t!</span></span></span>

<span style="color:#353535;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">15k is a long distance, of course, and this is reflected in the wide range of obstacles you’ll have to conquer during the event. Last year’s obstacles included hay stacks, monkey bars, hurdles, large walls, and high jumps, and we’re sure that this year will see some even more creative challenges!</span></span></span>

We must profess that one reason we’re so enthusiastic about The Grid is that the organising team itself seems so eager for it to be a success. Taking their ethos of determination every step of the way, the team claims that The Grid will happen irrespective of weather conditions, so you’re going to have to march whether it’s sunny or rainy. Of course, if weather conditions compromise the safety of the event, that’s a different issue entirely and one that would be addressed.

If you’re ready to carry the same ethos of determination, you’re definitely still in time to sign up for The Grid. Head over to thegridmalta.com to check out any details we might not have included here, including price points and how to go about your online registration.

            [blog_content] => ‘Water, water everywhere – and not a drop to drink’, wrote Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his famous poem, ‘The Rime of the Ancient Mariner’. Well, the sea in Malta might not be potable, but it sure is great for scuba diving.

We’ve spoken about exploring Malta on land. We’ve written about connecting with Malta’s beauty on cliffy heights. We’ve noted that there are many ways to appreciate the archipelago while in the sea. Malta is truly beautiful from all angles – but what happens when we go for an even deeper angle, namely under the sea?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2195" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-1.gif" alt="scuba 1.gif" width="480" height="360" />

In fact, you might not be surprised to learn that Malta is consistently rated as being one of the top destinations worldwide for scuba diving. It’s more than the fact that there’s sea all around us. Malta is full of intriguing dive sites because of the abundance of caves and reefs that make for gorgeous natural structures below the sea. Just as captivating are the myriad historical wrecks that you can observe first hand when scuba diving.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2196" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-2.gif" alt="scuba 2.gif" width="550" height="310" />

In addition to the beauty and intriguing stuff that lies under the depths of Malta’s seas, scuba diving in Malta is also an excellent choice because the variety in diving sites makes it suitable for all kinds of divers from absolute beginners to professionals. In fact, there are numerous sheltered and shallow bays that even the most inexperienced of divers can feel safe in.

<a name="_GoBack"></a><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2198" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-3.gif" alt="scuba 3.gif" width="640" height="360" />If you’re interested in testing out the waters of scuba diving (quite literally), Fun Malta is once again the gateway to adventure. By heading over to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving">https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving</a>, you can book your next scuba diving appointment directly, after checking out the different packages and price points on offer.

You can pick the right package for you based on your experience level. The beginner package, for example, covers completely controlled environments, and your guides will of course oversee you every step of the way. Commonly visited areas for this package include Valletta, Manoel island, Sirens Bay, Qawra Point, and Cirkewwa. The wide range of locations ensures that beginners aren’t simply subjected to sub-par dives, as there’s as much beauty and excitement to look forward to as there is in more advanced diving areas.

Furthermore, the beginner package is a great choice if you want to try out scuba diving as a unique family activity! However, your child will not be allowed to join unless he or she is at least 10 years old.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2198 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scuba-3.gif" alt="scuba 3" width="640" height="360" />

If you eventually decide you want to take scuba diving a little more seriously, you can also book PADI courses through Fun Malta, which will certify you as being eligible for more advanced dives!

Summer in Malta is synonymous with long, lazy days at the beach, golden tans, and that amazing feeling you get when you push your toes into the cool, shade-drenched sand. Whether you’re hitting the Maltese Islands for a few days, a couple of weeks, or even months, here are a few of the best beaches in Malta to help you unwind this summer! Grab your beach bag.
<ol>
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/blue-lagoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Blue Lagoon</a></b></li>
</ol>
Known the world over for its crystal-clear water and idyllic setting in Comino, Lagoon is an absolute must-see during your time here. To enjoy Comino and Blue Lagoon properly, you’ll need to spend at least one full morning or afternoon there, if not the whole day!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2262 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/blue-lagoon.jpg" alt="Blue Lagoon" width="2946" height="1964" />


<ol start="2">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/golden-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Bay</a> </b></li>
</ol>
Nestled between two sides of unmistakably Maltese terrain, you’ll find Golden Bay – the very first beach in Malta to get the coveted Blue Flag status. It’s perfect for families, and has all the amenities you’ll need for a very comfortable day at the beach. If you’ve got the time, stay and watch the sun set!

<ol start="3">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/ghajn-tuffieha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Għajn Tuffieħa</a></b></li>
</ol>
Just around the corner from Golden Bay, you’ll find its equally-attractive sibling – Għajn Tuffieħa. It’s an incredibly popular beach, and <i>can </i>get a little busy at times, but the sweeping, panoramic views are so beautiful, it’ll be worth it.

<ol start="4">
	<li><b>St. Peter’s Pool </b></li>
</ol>
If you’re feeling a little adventurous and don’t mind heading off the beaten track, then look no further than St. Peter’s Pool. This rocky bay is generally quiet, and not too far from the charming fishing village of Marsaxlokk – why not stop there for a delicious meal before heading back home?

<ol start="5">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/ghadira-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mellieħa Bay</a></b></li>
</ol>
Known to locals as Għadira, this is the island’s largest sandy beach and has quite a long stretch of shallow surf – perfect if you’re travelling with children. Għadira is generally quite busy, but it’s easy to get to and is Blue Flag certified too. There are bus stops really close by, and you’ll even find a few great options if you want a bite to eat during the day.

<ol start="6">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/paradise-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradise Bay</a></b></li>
</ol>
This aptly-named bay is tucked away near Ċirkewwa, cradled by white cliffs and perfectly-positioned to give you some great views of Gozo and Comino. Popular with families and snorkelers in particular, this beach offers you the chance to kick back, relax, and get to know the (underwater) locals better.

<b>BONUS: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/ramla-l-hamra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramla L-Ħamra</a></b>

Your Maltese adventure is incomplete without a visit to Gozo. Ramla L-Ħamra (The Red Sandy Beach) is a beautiful stretch of deep golden sand on the northern side of the island. Look to the eastern part of the hillside, and you’ll find a pathway that’ll take you to Calypso Cave, the same one Homer talks about in his famous work, The Odyssey!

            [blog_content] => Mothers. Sometimes, they can drive you up the wall, or nag you to the four corners of the earth. Little disputes here and there are inevitable with your mum. Regardless of all of that, your mother will always be one of the most important people in your life; perhaps the person who will always mean best for you even if you sometimes see the world a little differently.

Your mother gave you the greatest gift of all (no prizes for guessing what that is), and the 14<sup>th</sup> of May is an excellent opportunity for you to show appreciation for it. You might not be able to ever ‘return the favour’, but treating your mother in a thoughtful way is the best way to show you care.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2286" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mum-1.gif" alt="mum 1.gif" width="480" height="362" />
If you and your mother are in Malta this Mother’s Day, there’s are limitless options to choose from when it comes to making your one and only mum feel special. You’re the best person to know what she likes, but in case you needed some gift guidance (mothers can be an elusive bunch, after all), this article offers a few ideas!

<b>Get her a custom bouquet or floral décor
</b>
Though some people appreciate flowers as a gift, other see them as the easy way out. Grab a bouquet on the way home from work, and you’ve got a gift that smells nice but you put zero thought in.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2288" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mum-2.gif" alt="mum 2.gif" width="500" height="500" />

Going the custom route revitalises the whole thing, though. Malta is chockful of floral design experts that can put together flower arrangements that really represent what your mother is all about. Do any specific flowers remind you of her? Are there any colour patterns that she really finds soothing? A custom floral artist, like Alistair Fenech from Alistair Floral Design, can put together exactly what you need.

<b>Book a Family Photo Session with a Professional Photographer</b>

Material objects can be lovely, but nothing beats the warmth of good memories, and memories are no better captured than in photographs. Thanks to the power of the internet, pictures can be stored online forever, so the memories will always be there.

Though a smartphone might suffice when it comes to capturing spontaneous family moments, a professional with a great equipment and a keen eye will provide high quality and artistic photos that you can truly cherish forever.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2290" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mum-3.gif" alt="mum 3.gif" width="400" height="275" />

Your mother, like most mothers, might be the kind of person who always pines for more photos. If so, this is definitely the option we recommend the most.

<b>Buy her jewellery/clothing unique to Malta</b>

Clothing and jewellery are two options that you can’t go wrong with. What could make your mother feel better than an item that accentuates her beauty in addition to being a thoughtful gift from her child?

Some brands, though fancy indeed, can be found all around the world. Unless you know for a fact that your mother wants a specific item from a specific brand, we implore to do a little more research and opt for a unique Maltese option you won’t be able to get anywhere else. One example of this would be the gorgeous scarves made by the illustrious Saz Mifsud.

― Leonardo da Vinci

Most people in the modern world will have flown on a plane at least once in their life, and everyone will have his own personal reaction to the experience of flying. For some people, it’s exhilarating, for others terrifying. For many, it’s a rather mundane experience, which is pretty understandable considering that most people are ordinary passengers who don’t have do anything but sit down, read the in-flight magazine and eat their questionable complementary meal.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2296" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/flight-1.gif" alt="flight 1.gif" width="384" height="270" />
What if you get to take control of an aircraft for a little while, though? That completely changes the average person’s relationship to flying. While it might sound scary, we definitely encourage anyone with even the slightest hunger for adventure to give a trial flight a go!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/flight-2.gif" alt="flight 2.gif" width="500" height="377" />

There are two main reasons why we encourage the experience so much. The first is there’s an unmatchable rush of adrenaline that occurs in such an adventure. A lot of the activities we promote tend to be adrenaline-filled, but this is arguably one of the most unique things we’ve ever vouched for, and the thrill is really on another level as a result. The adrenaline might definitely be a product of fear, and while the scariness of the situation will be present, but you will of course be supervised every step of the way and so your safety will be a top priority on your trial flight.

The second reason hits a little closer to home in the very literal sense. Though you can enjoy a trial flight in many countries around the world, we are of course a Maltese organisation, and are recommending the activity as one to take up specifically while in Malta! Getting the chance to experience Malta from an aerial point of view is truly magical, and while you’ll have you keep your eyes on the sky, you’ll definitely be able to enjoy all the sights below you.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2299" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/flight-3.gif" alt="flight 3.gif" width="500" height="308" />

If you’re pining for your next (or first ever) trial flight, you can book directly through <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/trial-flights">https://www.funmalta.com/trial-flights</a>. You can choose from four different packages at different price points based on your preferences. You can opt for the introductory flight that lasts 30 minutes, the group flight in which everybody gets a turn, the extended flight, or the premium flight that lasts a whole 75 minutes. All four options have one thing in common: you’ll be exposed to gorgeous sights, and (comfortably) dizzying heights!

            [blog_content] => As the weather gently starts to shift from cool spring days into some slightly warmer weather, it’s easy to get a little excited about the Mediterranean summer on the horizon! Every year, thousands upon thousands of holiday-makers and adventure-seekers flock to Malta to take advantage of all the sun, sea, and fun this island gem has to offer. Whether you’re new to this kind of climate or a seasoned pro, take a look at some summer essentials to make sure you’re at your best this summer in Malta.

<h3>Sunglasses amp; a hat</h3>

One of the things people love most about our little island is the golden sunshine we enjoy most of the year! Be sure to protect yourself from getting <i>too much </i>sun by making sure you’ve got a good pair of sunnies and maybe even a hat for extra points. If you’re prone to sunburn, it might be a good idea to have some sunblock on hand for those long days out – nothing ruins a holiday faster than looking like a lobster in pain.

<h3>Water (and more water)</h3>

</ol>

Staying hydrated is important in your normal,day-to-day life, but if you’re dealing with warmer weather than you’re used to, then it becomes doubly important.

<h3>Lip Balm</h3>

Let’s face it – dry lips are basically evil incarnate and devilishly uncomfortable. Don’t fall victim to the cracked, burning discomfort that comes from neglecting your lips – get your hands on some good lip balm, preferably with UV protection.

<h3>Flip Flops</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/26BREJOhqNEhmNDxK.gif" alt="Andy Samberg GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

This should be your footwear of choice unless you plan on going on some sort of trek. Flip flops are perfect – you can just kick them off and dip your feet into the crystal-blue sea for a little paddle. If you’re style conscious, don’t worry – they’ve come a long way since the 90s.

<h3>A Fan</h3>

</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/cYnzSevqzhVoA.gif" alt="While You Were Sleeping GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

For some sweet relief when you’re feeling a bit too warm, get yourself one of those fans you’ve seen your grandmother use. She know what’s up, and you know she’s feeling chill as anything.
<ol start="6">
	<li>
<h3>A Good Book</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/RZnTaU1aKBjJm.gif" alt="Tv GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

A lazy summer’s day is incomplete without a good book to enjoy while you work on your tan or relax in the shade!

<h3>Camera</h3>

Trust us – you’re going to want to remember your Maltese summer. With so many breath-taking sights to see and experiences to enjoy you’ll be glad to have a camera on hand to leave you with a memento or two. Of course, if you have one of the latest smartphones, you won’t need an actual camera, but for that hint of nostalgia, why not treat yourself to an instant camera?

"western"><strong>Qigong amp; Taijiquan Seminar by GM Maurizio Zanetti – 27th May</strong>
"western"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2323" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/learn-2.gif" alt="learn 2.gif" width="200" height="200" />
"western">Martial arts are always a phenomenal way of staying fit and relaxing the mind simultaneously. Yet, most people are unaware of just how many different varieties of martial arts actually exist. Most of us can name four or five styles off the top of our heads, and we’re willing to bet that Qigong amp; Taijiquan aren’t usually one of them.
"western">Yet, sometimes the things least familiar to us can be the most rewarding. That’s why we recommend going to the Ramla Bay Resort to check out this amazing seminar, given by a European master, that can give you passion for a practice you never even knew existed!
"western"><strong>Publish and Market your Book – 21<sup>st</sup> May 2017</strong>
"western">There are so many inspired writers around who have very little knowledge of how to break into the literature scene. You might have no contacts, or you might be counting on fate to have you discovered. Don’t! Just like any life venture, results come with the right networking.
That’s why any up and coming author should really contact Filfla Publishing about their new initiative that helps people learn the dos and don’ts of getting your novel off your computer screen and into bookstores.
"western"><strong>SED – Science Camp – 23<sup>rd</sup> May</strong>

<h1 class="western"></h1>
This one is for kids! If your children are new to the world of science, the SED Science camp is a brilliant gateway in. There are monthly camp sessions happening until September, but if you won’t be in Malta till then you can simply send your child there a few times. One thing is for sure – SED is geared to give your child a deep appreciation for science and how it applies to life.

            [blog_content] => There’s a lot that can be said about Malta’s thriving nightlife, but that’s not exactly what this blog post is about<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">. </span></span>Whether you’re staying in Malta for a week or for several years, you’ll definitely find time to enjoy the island’s night time entertainment culture, whether you’re into clubs, concerts, or literally anything else under the Mediterranean sun (or perhaps we should say ‘moon’?).

Don’t hit the clubs just yet, though. We strongly recommend that check your schedule and fit in one other night time activity: a night tour of the island.



[caption id="attachment_2332" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class=" size-full wp-image-2332 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/night-2.jpg" alt="night 2" width="500" height="390" /> <i>Vittoriosa by night</i>[/caption]



You can bet money that if the Maltese islands are gorgeous by day, they’re equally gorgeous by night. People are recognising this more and more with each passing year, and several initiatives have been taken to celebrate Malta’s moon-kissed charm. One such initiative is the annual BirguFest, which is famous for its Birgu by Candlelight scheme. That’s exactly what you’d expect it to be: one of Malta’s maritime cities completely illuminated by candlelight.



[caption id="attachment_2341" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2341 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/night-3.jpg" alt="night 3].jpg" width="500" height="333" /> <i>Valletta at night</i>[/caption]



The Malta Night Tours are a little different though as they’re set on educating you about the cities you explore in a unique, captivating way. There are three tours available so far: The Vittoriosa Tour (so you get to see Birgu by night even if you won’t be in Malta for BirguFest), the Mdina Night Tour, and the Valletta Night Tour. Each tour takes approximately one and a half hours, and attendees can also opt to gather for a dinner at the site location. Each tour is led by a professional and licensed tour guide.
The question you must be asking, of course, is why you should opt for a night tour, as opposed to a day time tour. There are more reasons than you’d expect! For starters, a night tour will allow you to enjoy the city of your choice at a much less busy time, meaning you can ogle at the sights without getting caught in the middle of surrounding hustle and bustle.



[caption id="attachment_2343" align="aligncenter" width="308"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2343" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/night-4.jpg" alt="night 4.jpg" width="308" height="254" /> <em>Mdina by night</em>[/caption]



Night tours are also a great option for anyone who might be working in Malta and needs a way of familiarising themselves more with the archipelago. You can work in the morning and learn about the island after hours! It’s great for tourists too though – apart from the fact that you get to see Malta in a new light, a night tour can be a strategic way of immersing yourself in Malta’s history and culture on your first day if your flight is scheduled slightly late.

Just like most other tours, the Night Tours are an excellent group option. Each tour can accommodate up to 10 people. It also costs €108, and splitting that number between a high number of people makes the tour super affordable.

            [blog_content] => Let’s be honest – packing is probably the most annoying part of any holiday, no matter where you’re going. Some of us are packing ninjas, able to get organised and sort out a suitcase at a moment’s notice without breaking a sweat. Most of us mere mortals, however, need a little help – and possibly some divine intervention – to get things done. Without further ado, here are a few tips to get you packing like a pro.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/H5Q964PL6V1ao.gif" alt="No GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>1 | Make a List (or two)</b>

To-do list are fabulous little things that make us feel a sense of calm and control over the situation. But you can’t just stop at writing the list – you need to get down to business like Mulan in that Disney movie. Start off with a list of essentials, and make another one for the ‘nice to have’ items that you technically could live without. Pack the essentials first (including those important documents and some cash in the local currency) before moving on to the ‘nice to have’ bits. And you know you don’t need 3 pairs of flip flops. Put them down.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/ufNRtLbvvqnBK.gif" alt="Clothes GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>2 | Roll on</b>

You might already know someone who <i>rolls </i>their clothes instead of folding them the way mummy taught you to all those years ago. It might look a little strange at first, but give it a try – you’ll be surprised at how much space and time you’ll save! Think “sushi master”.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/RO023EYTyk5yg.gif" alt="Sushi GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>3 | Accessories at the top</b>

Leave accessories and smaller items to the very end to lessen the chances of finding that your new pair of earrings has become a crumble mess of metal and gemstones at the bottom of your bag. Placing these items further up in the bag-hierarchy will also help you to find these bits and pieces more easily when it comes to unpacking.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/2Ylp4JECyTYRi.gif" alt="Swag GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>4 | Know your limits</b>

Contrary to what <i>Mean Girls</i> may have taught us, there is indeed a limit. Be realistic about how many pairs of shoes you actually <b>need</b> versus how many you want to take with you (because you want options), and try to pack versatile items that you can use to style into a few different outfits. Also, be practical about how many pairs of underwear you need. Seriously.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/l2YWF00ZX8wOs0p0s.gif" alt="Math GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />



<b>5 | A word about liquids</b>

Or rather, three words: Zip. Lock. Bags. It might seem odd at first, but putting your liquids into these plastic bags will protect your beloved belongings from being covered in whatever decided to leak during your 3-hour flight. The last thing you need is a suitcase full of sunblock to go with your post-holiday blues.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/P4133zeloooHm.gif" alt="Panic GIF - Find amp; Share on GIPHY " />

<b>6 | Lock it down amp; dress it up </b>

If you haven’t already bought one – invest in a good, teeny-tiny lock to keep your things safe. Oh, and if you’re one of those people who struggle to recognise their own suitcase when you hit baggage reclaim, consider tying a colourful piece of ribbon to your bag, or buying a distinctive tag that’ll help you spot your suitcase (before you pick up someone else’s).

<b>1 | Flora’s, Naxxar</b>

This sweet little hangout is a real treat – pun fully intended. The décor is charming and every cupcake and pot of tea is baked and brewed with love.

<b>2 | Busy Bee, Msida</b>

Busy Bee is something of an institution around the Msida area. The café’s history dates back to 1933, when a gentleman called Ċensu Friggieri opened ‘Busy Bee Bar’, a confectionary serving up some of Malta’s best-loved sweets and treats, including the much-loved Cannoli.

<b>3 | Charles Grech, Valletta</b>

If you’re in the mood for something a little on the fancy side, look no further than Charles Grech in our beautiful capital, Valletta! The café is in Republic street, just past the ruins of the majestic Royal Opera House, now an open-air performance space.

<b>4 | Café Jubilee, Valletta and Gzira</b>

Take a step back in time and nestle into a cosy corner over at Café Jubilee! The vintage décor and delicious food and drink will keep you coming back for more, and you might even get the chance to enjoy a bit of live music while you dig in to some dessert!

<b>5 | Fontanella, Mdina </b>

By far one of the most well-known cafés on the island, Fontanella is the ideal place to rest your tired legs after a full day of sightseeing around Malta’s old capital, affectionately nicknamed “The Silent City”. Our top tip? Try the chocolate cake.

            [blog_content] => The future is here, and its name is Jetfly. Just take a look at the cover photo in this article. Doesn’t that look like something you want to do right now? Or do you find it somewhat terrifying?

If you’re still trying to figure out what Jetfly is all about, it’s a pretty straightforward concept. You strap a water-propelled jetpack to your body that allows you to hover 10 metres into the air. Although that might seem scary, the fact of the matter is that the technology used for Jetfly is advanced enough that controlling the jetpack is pretty straightforward and relies on light fingertip control. You can move in all directions as well as land with ease.

<i>Kind of like this, but over water.</i>

Though we’re pretty sure that the main point of attraction with jetflying lies in the pure thrill of the activity itself, but a definite bonus is that being propelled into the air in that way will give you a gorgeous view of your Maltese surroundings!

Oh, and just in case you needed a slightly more cultural spin on this article, the jetflying team operates from a historic boat, the Cutty Jean, which really adds a new depth to the whole experience.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2376" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/jetfly-2.jpg" alt="jetfly 2.jpg" width="960" height="540" />

There are two main options when it comes to your Jetfly adventure: you can either fly solo, or in tandem with a certified instructor, which is also known as the Joy Ride. The differences are pretty straightforward.

If you choose the tandem option, you’ll mostly be controlled by the instructor and you can simply enjoy the ride without having to worry about getting to grips with the way everything works. If you don’t plan on jetflying regularly, or if you have younger children (children must be at least 4 years old to jetfly in tandem), this could definitely be the choice for you.

The solo option includes an actual lesson on how to manoeuvre and you can put what you’ve learnt to practice as you won’t have the instructor controlling your every step as you fly! This is the option we recommend if you like to be a bit more intuitive and adventurous. It’s also great for anyone aged 12 and up.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2378 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/jetfly-3.jpg" alt="jetfly 3" width="951" height="607" />

There are a few other factors that might influence your decision. For example, the Joy Ride option comes with a weight limit of 75 kg while the Solo option has no such restriction. Price might also factor in, but the difference is actually really negligible: Solo flights cost €80 while the Joy Ride is €70.

As usual, there’s no need to worry about how and where you can book your Jetfly experience, as you can book directly through <a href="http://www.funmalta.com/jetfly">www.funmalta.com/jetfly</a>!

            [blog_content] => You might have never thought so, but Malta has definitely had its fair share of celebrities over the years, and some of them have had a substantial impact even on an international level. There have also been plenty of celebrities and rising stars with Maltese blood in them, like Britney Spears, Bryan Adams, and Tash Sultana. However, this article is more concerned with celebrities who were either at least born in Malta or lived in Malta for a substantial portion of their lives.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and because of that we’ll definitely have a couple more of these in the near future. Keep an eye out! Until then, here’s our first batch of Maltese celebs.

<b>Marama Corlett</b>

<b><img class=" size-full wp-image-2383 alignleft" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-1.jpg" alt="celebs 1.jpg" width="400" height="558" /></b>Of all the people in this list, Marama Corlett is probably the one that’s the current talk of the town. That’s definitely to be expected from someone who has acted in television series like <b>Sinbad</b> and <b>Rina</b>, and films like <b>Guardians of the Galaxy</b> and <b>Maleficent</b>!

Corlett’s latest venture is in a new science fiction television series called <b>Blood Drive</b> that is definitely not suitable for kids! We’ll refrain from discussing the details here, but do check it out if you’re into shows that aren’t afraid to toe the line of gore and debauchery!



<b>Joseph Calleia</b>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2386 alignright" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-2.jpg" alt="celebs 2.jpg" width="245" height="298" />

No, not our beloved tenor! Joseph Calleia was a Maltese-born American actor and singer who lived between 1897 and 1975. Calleia featured in numerous works across various genres including musical comedy, Broadway, and was also well-known for excelling at acting as villains in Hollywood films.

Some of the films you’ll be able to find Calleia in include <b>Algiers</b>, <b>Five Came Back</b>, <b>Golden Boy</b>, <b>Gilda</b>, and <b>Touch of Evil</b> (considered to be his magnum opus in terms of performance).

<b>Joseph Calleja</b>

We had to include Malta’s most famous tenor, of course. Though Calleja is respected by practically everyone locally, perhaps it’s safe to say that not all that many Maltese people understand that he is not just a national treasure. Calleja has gained various recognitions of his talent including winning the 1998 Caruso Competition in Milan and also winning a prize in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pl%C3%A1cido_Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operalia_International_Opera_Competition">Operalia International Opera Competition</a> in 1999. Furthermore, Calleja is a member of the Board of Directors of the European Academy of Music Theatre!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2388" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-3.jpg" alt="celebs 3.jpg" width="662" height="441" />

We’re sure that many people also still remember when Joseph Calleja was the guest tenor at the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in 2012, where he performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra!

<b>Marc Storace</b>

<b><img class=" size-full wp-image-2390 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-4.jpg" alt="celebs 4.jpg" width="410" height="274" /></b>

Marc Storace is a different kind of singer. Actually, he’s a very different kind of singer. Based in Switzerland, Storace is the singer for acclaimed hard rock band Krokus, a band that has been active since 1980.

Storace’s voice has been compared to that of Bon Scott, the original singer for the legendary AC/DC. Such is the case that he was even invited to audition when Scott passed away – and Storace, like an absolute champ, graciously refused the offer because he wanted to focus on Krokus. If that’s not dedication, we don’t know what is.
<b>Francis Ebejer</b>

<b><img class=" size-full wp-image-2391 alignright" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/celebs-5.jpg" alt="celebs 5.jpg" width="300" height="456" /></b>If you’ve never really explored Maltese literature, you might not initially think that a local author could receive international acclaim – not because Maltese literature has ever been stagnant, but because most authors, understandably, write in their mother tongue. Though Ebejer never shied away from writing in Maltese, he also had a formidable repertoire in English.

Ebejer was praised extensively for his contributions to both literature and theatre, and some of the awards he received included the Malta Literary Award, the Phoenicia Cultural Trophy, the Cheyney Award, and La Medaille d’Honneur de la Ville d’Avignon.

            [blog_content] => Biking in Malta does not always seem to be a popular mode of transport, and that’s pretty understandable considering that Maltese roads are usually quite busy, making biking a pretty risky option most of the time.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2475" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/bike.gif" alt="bike.gif" width="800" height="600" />
If you want to get your biking fix, though, you can go for the road less travelled and book an offroad biking activity through Fun Malta! This will let you explore all the facets of Malta that you love from unique, fresh angles.
Our offroad biking adventures come with various stops including Mdina, various wayside chapels, and even Neolithic temples. You’ll also get to see gorgeous landscapes along the way, such as cliffs and coastlines. This is what makes offroad biking more than just an athletic trip – it’s an insight into Malta’s culture, nature and history.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2478" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/bike-2.gif" alt="bike 2.gif" width="245" height="165" />

Offroad biking is available all the year round, though you will have to be prepared to combat the weather depending on the season. The worst of summer is soon coming up, so make sure that your hydration game is on point. What’s more is that people who are not used to biking (which is not actually that surprising in today’s urban culture) need not worry as there are various routes you can select and this means there are differing levels of difficulty that you can choose from.

Speaking of options, there are loads here, as you can book a half or full day and can furthermore choose whether you want to be one person, a small number of people, or a large group. Transport can be arranged to and from site, while for full day bookings a light lunch will also be provided. Prices, of course, differ depending on the selection.

            [blog_content] => We had loads of fun writing our previous article on Maltese celebrities, and that’s one of the reasons why we had to write another one (and will possibly write more in the future). The other reason is that our last article only scratched the surface of Maltese people who have a made an impressive name for themselves abroad!

This article is going to be more rooted in the music industry, so we’re going to tell you about people of various talents, from singing to composing.

<b>Destiny Chukunyere</b>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hju_YlRgUec

<b>
</b>Destiny is still in her early teenage years, but she’s quickly becoming one of Malta’s biggest stars. Destiny claimed a lot of initial fame when she won the 2015 edition of the Junior Eurovision, but prior to that she had also won the Asterisks Music Festival and SanRemo Junior.

Destiny is currently the talk of the town for singing Aretha Franklin’s ‘Think’ and passing the audition stage at Britain’s Got Talent this year, receiving a staggering 4 yeses and resounding praise from the judges!

<b>Kevin Borg</b>

Speaking of killing it in international competitions, Kevin Borg is famous for winning the Swedish competition <i>Idol</i> in 2008. Apart from having a great voice, Borg rose to fame for being the first winner to be born outside of Sweden.

<b>Joseph Vella</b>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKfbi3tyyu8

Joseph Vella is one of Malta’s leading and innovative composers, with a substantial international following. He is known for his unique sound, mostly inspired by the neo-classical movement but with other influences seeping in, including Mediterranean sounds. Vella is known for his ability to experiment while retaining a profound sense of musicality.

<b>Nicky Bomba</b>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf65pQXqFhM

Maltese born, Australian bred multi-instrumentalist Nicky Bomba has received wide acclaim for his various musical projects including Bomba and the Melbourne Ska Orchestra, in which he is the bandleader. For many years, Bomba was also the drummer for the famous John Butler.

Sandro Zerafa is the only musician on this list that specialises in jazz. The Maltese guitarist studied and made his name in France, though he has also toured on an international level. His performances and albums are certainly worth checking out if you are a jazz aficionado at all, as he certainly holds in own in the international scene.

            [blog_content] => Summer is almost upon us, and with the changing of the seasons comes the changing of a variety of other things. You change your wardrobe, your shoe closet, your favourite hangout spots, and inevitably, your diet. The heat makes us crave fresh, salty and summery foods, foods the Maltese have been eating for years on end. So beat the heat and indulge in some traditional Maltese grub!
<h2>1. Zebbug Mimli</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BTdxwiHDa1S/?tagged=zebbugmimliamp;hl=en

A staple in every Maltese party, Holy Communion, wedding, and BBQ, these tiny, tasty stuffed goodies are a must. These go well with many other food items on this list, and embody that salty, fresh taste that we so crave in Summer. You can buy stuffed olives straight from the store, however, if you fancy a more authentic taste, <a href="http://www.ilovefood.com.mt/recipes/zebbug-mimli-stuffed-olives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try preparing them yourself</a>!
<h2>2. Ftira biz-Zejt</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BLOIh1jjDJ0/?tagged=hobzbizzejtamp;hl=en

Ah, the epitome of Maltese cuisine, one of the simplest foods packing the most intense flavours. The Hobz biz-Zejt, or Ftira biz-Zejt, has been proven to taste best by the seaside, and is the perfect snack to pack for a picnic or a day at the beach. You can really and truly assemble it any which way you like, however, the 'official' version remains <a href="http://www.malta.com/en/dining/maltese-specialities/hobz-biz-zejt-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a>.
<h2>3. Bigilla</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNFJN7WlgBE/?tagged=bigillaamp;hl=en

Bigilla can be crowned as the Official Maltese Dip, and it has quite the celebrity status on the island. Made from dried broad beans, this traditional dip is another standard BBQ appetizer, or any kind of appetizer really (you'll find Bigilla served at bars and <em>kazini </em>around the island). Readily found in most convenient stores and supermarkets, this dip is <a href="http://www.malta.com/en/dining/maltese-specialities/bigilla-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite easy to make if you're up to it</a>!
<h2>4. Bebbux</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BR0e7gxA8AE/?tagged=bebbuxamp;hl=en

Bebbux is Maltese for snails, or <em>escargots</em> in French. The Maltese dish is quite different from the French one though, traditionally served with Arjoli (a pasty goodness mainly made from tuna and anchovies) on Good Friday, or as a stew with heavenly gravy. This typical Maltese dish is the perfect side to a cold beer, thus making it perfect for summer. Try the recipe <a href="http://www.ilovefood.com.mt/uncategorized/bebbux-bl-aljoli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!
<h2>5. Gbejniet</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BS3Vftsgd7k/?tagged=gbejnaamp;hl=en

Gbejna (<em>pl. gbejniet</em>) is a typical Maltese cheese, traditionally associated with our sister island of Gozo. These small round cheeses are made from sheep's milk, and can be found in various forms: fresh (<em>gbejna friska)</em>, sun-dried, salt cured, or peppered (<em>gbejna tal-bzar</em>). These go extremely well with Hobz biz-Zejt, even though they're delicious on their own! You can find <em>gbejniet</em> at your nearest convenience store or supermarket.
<h2>6. Qaqocc Mimli</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BLR4H0wALCb/?tagged=qaqoccmimliamp;hl=en

Qaqocc mimli translates to stuffed artichokes, another must of Maltese cuisine. Each Maltese household has its own different recipe, some cutting the leaves and filling the heart, some pushing the leaves back and stuffing them with the filling - you won't find the same dish twice, but they're all mouth-wateringly exquisite. Try this recipe <a href="http://www.malta.com/en/dining/maltese-specialities/qaqocc-mimli-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and enjoy with some tasty Mediterranean salad on the side!
<h2>7. Helwa tat-Tork</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUKNflVFnTM/?tagged=helwatattorkamp;hl=en

This list could not be complete without something sweet. Helwa tat-Tork is an oriental sweet made up of tahini, almonds and vanilla. It has a texture like no other, and can be sickly sweet if consumed in abundance! The Maltese usually have this sweet with some coffee at the end of a large meal, and it is traditionally also served in parties and festivities. Although readily available in most supermarkets, <a href="http://www.ilovefood.com.mt/recipes/helwa-tat-tork-halva-%E2%80%93-turk%E2%80%99s-sweet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can try your hand at making it yourself</a>!

            [blog_content] => Travelling with kids is quite a feat. From the very first moments of packing til the last car ride home, keeping children entertained can be somewhat difficult. That's why we have compiled a list of fun activities which you can enjoy with your kids, while on holiday in Malta! We're sure you'll find something which you and your brood will relish.
<h2>1. Kayaking</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2582" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kayaking.jpg" alt="Kayaking" width="1023" height="631" />

Being an island in the middle of one of the most gorgeous seas, Malta is a water sports playground. So it is evident that you will find a myriad of aquatic activities which are suitable for adults and also for children. Kayaking is one such sport, where you can make most of the scenery, while your kid has fun splashing around! It is also a perfect bonding sport, where you can teach your child how to row. Make the most of Malta's waters and book your kayaking/bonding session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/kayaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2587" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/p1000768p.jpg" alt="P1000768P.JPG" width="2560" height="1920" />
<h2>2. Jetfly</h2>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-2588 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jetfly-2.jpg" alt="jetfly 2.jpg" width="1328" height="747" />

As we highlighted in our <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/05/24/jetfly-is-it-one-of-maltas-coolest-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blog post</a>, Jetflying has become a popular activity among adults and kids alike, turning all your childhood jet-pack dreams into reality. While this activity cannot be done in tandem with your child, you can take it in turns (children will be accompanied by the instructor at all times) to experience one of life's greatest thrills; propelling through the air like a cartoon character! It will surely be a memorable (and really cool!) experience for your kids - and for you too! Sign up for a jet-flying session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/jetfly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2594" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jetfly-1.png" alt="jetfly 1.png" width="694" height="521" />
<h2>3. Snorkeling</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2597" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/mg_5855untitled.jpg" alt="_MG_5855untitled.jpg" width="1199" height="745" />

Another water-based activity, snorkeling is a great way to introduce your kids to the wonders which lie just beneath the sea's surface. With a locally experienced guide to show you the best place to spot the best fish, children are sure to be entertained with this combination of swimming and discovery of a new habitat, and this can be also an introduction to Scuba Diving later on! Book your Snorkeling session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/snorkeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and explore a whole new world under the sea!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2604" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/mg_5896untitled.jpg" alt="_MG_5896untitled.jpg" width="1197" height="747" />
<h2>4. Horse Riding</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2606" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/horseriding4.jpg" alt="horseriding4.jpg" width="1440" height="810" />

If you (or your kids) prefer to try something more earth-bound, Horse Riding may be just the thing for you. This activity would be ideal for children who love animals, and can be a nice treat for adults too. Taking place in one of Malta's most beautiful locations, Golden Bay, these Horse Riding sessions offer a calm and peaceful activity amidst the beauty of nature, a truly memorable experience for you and your children. So giddy up and book your Horse Riding session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2613" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/horseriding5.jpg" alt="horseriding5.jpg" width="960" height="720" />
<h2>5. Segway Tours</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2614" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/malta-segway-tours.jpg" alt="malta-segway-tours.jpg" width="720" height="478" />

One for the older kids (children of 12 years and up can do this activity), a Segway Tour is an innovative and enjoyable way of taking in the sights and learning more about Malta. The kids will have a blast on the Segway, while the parents will get a cultural tour around Malta's most beautiful spots (and enjoy the Segway ride too, we bet!). With three fantastic routes to choose from, you'll be spoilt for choice (and keep tweens entertained), which is a win win situation! Book your tour <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2619" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/segway-dingli.jpg" alt="SEGWAY DINGLI.jpg" width="1123" height="632" /></h2>
<h2>6. SUP Yoga</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2622" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/sup-yoga-4.jpg" alt="SUP Yoga 4.jpg" width="960" height="695" />

We had explored the benefits of SUP Yoga in <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/04/07/whats-better-than-regular-yoga-sup-yoga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of our earlier posts</a>, and one of the main advantages of this fairly new activity is that it is actually a lot of fun! You and your child will be getting a good workout too, and being a water-based activity, we're sure it will be a hit with young ones. SUP Yoga can also be a great family bonding session, as there are no age or sex restrictions. Book your relaxing SUP Yoga session <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/sup-yoga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and enjoy some much needed mindfulness for the whole family!

            [blog_content] => Our dads are some of the most special persons in our lives. They give us life, they care for us in our early years (and sometimes even much later), and they give us wise and sage advice whenever we need it - sometimes even when we don't, but they always have our best intentions at heart. It is only fair that this day is dedicated to the unsung superheroes that they are, and that we give them the special treatment.
<h2>1. Spend a Day at the Beach</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVJs7ZNB8uE/?taken-at=240531053

Remember when you were just a little kid and your dad used to pack half of your belongings into the family car and take you to the beach? You can now return the favour! Surprise your dad with a planned beach day, either just you two, or with the whole family in tow. Relive some old memories and make some new ones! Your dad will surely appreciate a relaxing day by the sea, chilling with his family. Speaking of chilling, since you are now an adult, you can chill even further by sharing a beer or two with dad! (Just remember to drink responsibly, and NEVER drink and drive)

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVXvAEMDbUE/?tagged=gnejna
<h2>2. Organise a Picnic</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUY7B8BAkGC/?taken-at=250915203

Same as with beach days, your dad has spent countless days preparing for picnics and family outings in the countryside. As before, it is only proper that you return the favour. Prepare some delicious Maltese appetizers (or buy them at the supermarket if you're super busy), pack some fancy Maltese wine, a large blanket, and you're set to go! Once again, you can even invite the whole family and celebrate this special day together. Make sure to pack a football and relive old memories of kicking about and keeling over in mock pain at the slightest bruise!

<h2>3. Plan a Historical Outing</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVZEW18A4-Q/?taken-at=222667676

This one should be very simple to do - we do live in an open-air museum after all! Malta is a treasure trove of historical locations, and if your dad is somewhat of a history buff, this will surely make his day. Pick a spot (you can close your eyes and point a the Maltese map, it's <em>that</em> easy), and take your dad out for an impromptu guided tour by the man whose advice you should always follow. Your dad has been around for longer than you have, and he's bound to know some juicy secrets and lesser known facts about your favourite historical location.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BThdDK6Dl-J/?taken-at=216410480
<h2>4. Go on a Day Trip to Gozo</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVY-399FDI6/?tagged=gozo

That is, if you are from Malta. If you're Gozitan, why not plan a day trip to Malta? The point is, you can plan a day overland with your dad and maybe your lvoed ones as well. Being as limited as we are, we do not have much options when it comes to overland trips. However, our trusted sister island is always there, and makes for a perfect little day trip where you can visit new places, or re-visit old places! Admire the islands from the ferry and sample some of Gozo's famous specialities while you're there. Bonus points if you get some for back home!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVXSlB1F_0V/?tagged=gozo
<h2>5. Cook a Special Father's Day Sunday Lunch</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVCAje7hlvB/?tagged=maltesefood

Prepare a delectable Maltese dish for your dad (and maybe your whole family too) and take over the chef's apron this Sunday. Think about your dad's favourite dish, or ask your mum how to prepare his absolute favourite food, roll up your sleeve, and get to cooking! Your dad will surely appreciate the effort, and you can hone your culinary skills while donig so as well. This is also a good alternative for anyone who has not yet bought a Father's Day gift!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BUGyticB5GK/?tagged=maltesefood
<h2>6. Visit a Village Festa</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVVYig0j4Y4/?taken-at=4248039

With the Feast of St Philip coming up this Sunday, you can treat your dad to some precious festa time together! This works great if your dad is a festa enthusiast, or a fireworks enthusiast, or if he just loves to have fun. Festas are basically just big street party, and would surely be a fun way to spend Father's Day with your dad. Make sure to grab some yummy Festa food as well - we're sure your dad would appreciate some nougat for his special day!

            [blog_content] => As sunny summer days shift into sultry nights, Malta comes alive with warm streetlights, twinkling starts spread across the sky, and the sound of energetic Maltese chatter as the whole island steps out to enjoy the cool evening air. Exploring Malta by night is probably one of the best things to do during the summer months – here are just a few favourites to help get you started on your night-time excursions!
<h1 class="western">1 | Mdina</h1>
When it comes to getting a taste of Maltese history, it doesn’t get much better than The Silent City, a beautiful walled city with sweeping views of its surrounding towns and countryside. Mdina is full of adorable little squares and hidden side streets that offer visitors an almost-constant gentle breeze. The ancient citadel was fortified by the Phoenicians around 1000 B.C., but its present name comes from the arrival of the Arabs in the 9<sup>th</sup> century, when they named the city ‘Medina’, meaning ‘walled city’. The old dry moat that once protected the city from attack was recently transformed into a public garden filled with neatly-trimmed lawns and walkways, making it the perfect place for an evening walk.

<h1 class="western">2 | Valletta</h1>
Malta’s majestic capital and the best place to be if you want to take in some stunning architecture while sipping on an ice-cold gin and tonic in one of its many buzzing bars and restaurants. Built by the Knights of St. John and named after Grand Master Jean de Vallette, Valletta is a relatively small capital city bursting with history, culture, and entertainment.

<h1 class="western">3 | Birgu</h1>
Also known by its Italian name, Citta Vittoriosa, Birgu is a magnificent fortified city with great views of Valletta and full of typically-Maltese charm. The proud city’s origins date back to the medieval period, pre-dating the dawn of Valletta’s reign as capital. Head down to the peaceful Vittoriosa Waterfront, where you’ll find a casino, the Malta Maratime Museum, and the Vittoriosa Museum to name just a few sights. Birgu is also the perfect place for a night out, with countless wine bars and restaurants waiting to be discovered among its many narrow streets.

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If soaking up the sun on a beach in Malta is not your cup of tea, look no further. Here are six fun and wholesome activities you can enjoy with  friends, family or all by your lonesome self, away from the sweltering heat of the Maltese islands.</span>Visit the Malta Aquarium
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">1. Visit the Malta Aquarium</span></h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVj2Xt3DsNX/

<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta’s one and only aquarium is located in Qawra, a coastal village situated in the north of Malta. The aquarium boasts of a variety of Mediterranean species of fish and aquamarine creatures found swimming in the Maltese coastal regions and Mediterranean sea, as well as tropical species found outside of the European seas. Expect a colourful array of sea creatures, as well as a spin on Maltese culture and history, including an exhibit of the anchor rumoured to belong to the shipwreck which brought St Paul to our island, as well as the island's Catholic faith. It is, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">however, not limited to exhibiting fish, as one may also view reptiles and amphibians. A must-see for children and all those who have a secret marine-biologist, tucked away inside of them.</span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/PQid6TEa9iIgM/giphy.webp" />
<h2>2. Escape to Scavenger Escape Rooms</h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">There’s no age limit for this one- it is as exciting for kids as it is for adults. Form a team of two to six people and head over to the Qui-Si Sana seafront in Sliema, where new adventures await you. Choose between three differently themed rooms; the Egyptian Adventure, the Mozart Mystery and the Secret Surgery rooms, all rated easy, medium and hard respectively. You have sixty minutes to crack the mystery- the sooner you figure out the puzzles, the higher the chance of breaking their records. Guaranteed to get your adrenaline pumping!</span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/q4sdF9tchap6E/giphy.webp" />
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">3. Cool off with a Ġelat</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Ġelat is a Maltese word for everyone's favourite summer (and let's be honest, winter) treat- ice-cream! Favoured by adults and kids alike, there’s nothing more refreshing than a tasty, ice-cold ice-cream. One of the best places that offers such a snack is Sotto Zero, located in Bugibba. This ice cream parlour has a wide variety of flavours available, including sugar free, vegan and lactose free options. If you don’t fancy making the trip during the day, head over to Sotto Zero for a late night treat, as they are open until the very early hours of the day. Kinder bueno ice-cream, anyone? </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/aQ0PfLFwagW52/giphy.webp" />
<h2>4. Bowling- right up your alley!</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUMHv9SFnZH/?taken-by=eden_leisure_group

<span style="font-weight:400;">Get competitive and head over to the busy town of St Julians, to Eden Superbowl, for a game of bowling with family and friends. There’s nothing like an intense game of bowling accompanied by a few drinks, or watching your kids cheer gleefully as they attempt to drop all the skittles.  And if that’s too boring for you, why not try the disco bowling feature? Available every Friday night, get lost in the game accompanied by music and cool glow in the dark effects of the lanes and the balls. Also, once you’ve worn out the game, why not head over to the arcade section for some old school arcade games? A truly fun and unforgettable experience. </span>
<h2>5. <span style="font-weight:400;">Lose yourself in St John's Co-Cathedral</span></h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVoehbFBvfJ/?taken-at=338413193

<span style="font-weight:400;">Brave the crowds of tourists in Valletta's Republic street and head over to the square, where, facing the Law Courts, you will find the visitor's entrance to what is known as one of the finest examples of high Baroque architecture in Europe. One of the many gems that the Order of Saint John gifted us, it is a full immersion into the art, history and culture that Malta's capital city has to offer. It was Grand Master Raphael Cotoner himself who ordered that the interior of the church be decorated so as to compete with Rome's finest churches, and tourists and citizens alike believe that he has succeeded. Inside the Co-Cathedral, one will find a marble floor, housing a series of tombs belonging to 400 Knights of the order, and a crypt containing the tombs of various Grand Masters, including one belonging to Valletta's name sake, Jean Parisot de Valette. Make sure to pass by The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist by Caravaggio, the most famous work of art in the church. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">6. Saunter around the Silent City by Night</span></h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVkg6YzFLQH/?taken-at=222667676

<span style="font-weight:400;">A personal favorite- this fortified city is located at the top of a hill within the Northern Region of Malta. It is said that due to it's elevated position on the island, it is always a few degrees colder than the rest of Malta, making it a must-see for those who suffer in the heat. It's equally beautiful by day, yet by night, a peaceful silence overwhelms the city. Explore the narrow side streets, enjoy the various types of cuisine it has to offer, or just admire the views in silence- you are sure to fall in love with the Medieval city. You could always book a tour through FunMalta Night Tours (follow this link-<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours</a>) and let a proffessional guide you and show you all there is to Mdina's rich history.  Bonus tip- visit the Fontanella Café for a taste of some of the most scrumptious cakes on the island, because, who doesn't love cake?</span>

            [blog_content] => Summer in Malta is a pretty special affair, with endless sunny days and boundless blue seas wherever you turn. The first thing that comes to mind when people think about this piece of Mediterranean paradise is probably an image of sandy beaches and lazy days spent at the beach. While swimming is a popular way to unwind here, that’s not the only thing we do for fun – here are just 7 other <a href="http://www.funmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things to do in Malta</a> <!-- https://www.funmalta.com/home  -->this summer!
<h2>1. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S</a><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cuba Diving</a></h2>
A summer visit to Malta is nothing but incomplete without a good scuba diving session! Our islands may be small, but there are loads of different dive sites for you to be entranced by, from long-forgotten wrecks to colourful reefs and caves.

Get your nearest and dearest together and book a charter boat to fully enjoy the natural beauty of our enchanting coastline! All you need for the perfect day at sea is a boat full of friends and a cooler packed with ice-cold drinks and tasty snacks. Oh, and don’t forget the music.

<h2>5. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horse Riding</a></h2>
Spending a few hours exploring idyllic Maltese countryside on horseback is probably one of the most rewarding experiences you could have during a Maltese summer. Pair up with one of these gentle creatures and enjoy an incredible, fiery sunset together with your friends.

<h2>6. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/abseiling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abseiling</a></h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/4ZDZWytxGC/?tagged=abseilingmalta

Abseiling is an awesome way to see the island from a totally different perspective as you spend a few hours scaling Malta’s most rugged cliffs and tallest heights. New to abseiling? Don’t worry – you can find guides who’ll teach you how to rappel down smaller, less intimidating spots. You’ll be the next Spiderman (or woman) before you know it!
<h2>7. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/snorkeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snorkeling</a></h2>
If you’re visiting Malta over the summer months, then you absolutely can’t miss a bit of snorkelling in our crystal-blue sea. Just beneath the water’s surface, you’ll find a whole world of colourful fish, fauna, and magical rock formations that’ll make for an experience that’s not only fascinating, but serene.

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If you're in Malta, and your Instagram is full of selfies, or pictures of your dog (no judgement), and you feel it needs some refurbishment, go on an expedition to some of Malta's most heart-worthy sites, and get snapping. Guaranteed to get you more followers! </span>
<h2>1. Sail Around our favourite sister island, Comino</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BV4UmYLlt-8/?tagged=comino

<span style="font-weight:400;">Sun, sea, and 50 shades of blue, is all you need for a fabulous snap of the tiny island of Comino. Great, for snorkeling, diving, or just for showing off your new unicorn floatie- the possibilities are endless. The island's main attraction is the Blue Lagoon, and it sure lives up to its name- its light teal shade is truly mesmerizing. And if you want to spice it up, why not charter a yacht through Fun Malta (follow the link here- </span><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/yacht-charter"><span style="font-weight:400;">https://www.funmalta.com/yacht-charter</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">) and spend your day in total luxury with family and friends. The yacht will take you around Gozo and Comino, which could only mean more snaps! #fabulous!</span>
<h2>2. <span>Pose next to our </span><i><span>other </span></i><span>Window</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Malta lost one of its most treasured natural gems; the Azure Window of Gozo. It was a sad day for the island, almost like losing a dear friend, or a family pet. </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Pd8Bf06Sas4yQ/giphy.gif" />

<span style="font-weight:400;"> This is what it looks like now- </span>

<pre><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Courtesy of Sarah Pace Warrington </span></i></pre>
<span style="font-weight:400;">However, natives were quick to point out that Gozo has yet </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">another </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">window; the Azure Window's long lost little sister- the one in Wied il-Mielaħ. </span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BR1XM6-jKCg/?tagged=gozowindow

<span style="font-weight:400;">Take advantage of the Gozo Express Tour offered by Fun Malta (follow this link- </span><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-express-tour"><span style="font-weight:400;">https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-express-tour</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">) and get your thumb moving; Gozo is full of beautiful scenery and majestic views. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">#Islandlife </span><span style="font-weight:400;">😎</span>
<h2>3. Drop by our Fishing village, Marsaxlokk</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BV4WgwDha7d/?tagged=malta

<span style="font-weight:400;">Marsaxlokk is Malta's traditional fishing village; the village’s name comes from </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">marsa</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, which means "port" and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">xlokk</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, which is the local name for south east. Join the "Xlukkajri" at the Marsaxlokk Market, a large mark which takes place around the entire village on Sundays, or visit the tourist market any day of the week, or just absorb the sea air and the colourful "luzzu" boats, a symbol of Malta's fishing trade. #bythesea </span><span style="font-weight:400;">⛵</span>
<h2>4. Stroll around the Upper Barrakka Gardens</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BTWdoESAA0Y/?taken-by=sarah.p.w
<pre><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Courtesy of Sarah Pace Warrington </span></i></pre>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you happen to be in Valletta, walk to the Upper Barrakka Gardens for a spectacular view of the Grand Harbour, one of Malta's finest sites. The gardens are located on the upper tier of the Saint Peter and Paul bastion. The lower tier contains the Saluting Battery. In the park, one will find several monuments or memorials depicting several historical figures, such as Gerald Strickland, Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Thomas Maitland. There is also a replica statue of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Les Gavroches, </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">created by Antonio Sciortino, one of Malta's finest sculptors. #cultural </span><span style="font-weight:400;">🤓</span>
<h2>5. Snap our Sea views</h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Roam around Sliema's promenade, and catch a glimpse of Valletta's seafront, and its medieval, traditional architecture. There's nothing more picturesque than the seafront during sunset:-</span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BVjpyHMAgyg/?taken-by=sarah.p.w
<pre><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Courtesy of Sarah Pace Warrington </span></i></pre>
<span style="font-weight:400;">And, if you like a more modern view, switch it up! Go to Valletta and take a photograph of Sliema's seafront. The contrast is uncanny; it is urban and almost  futuristic, in comparison to Valletta. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Side by side, these snaps are a work of art! #artsyfartsy</span>
<h2>6. Admire the heights of Dingli Cliffs</h2>
Scared of heights?

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/QG0XQms55iOpa/giphy.gif" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Get over your fear with a good selfie. Visit Dingli Cliffs, situated in Dingli, in the Nothern Region of the Maltese Islands. The cliffs are situated at one of the highest points of the island, some 250 meters above sea level. The cliffs provide open sea views and a glimpse at the isle of Filfa, an uninhabited rock along the coast. One can also spot the Buskett Gardens and Verdala Palace, but also areas of garrigue land. Perfect for a picnic, or just drive by to admire the view. #fearofheightsconquered </span><span style="font-weight:400;">😎</span>

<h2>7.  Soak in the Sand, Sun and Sea at Għajn Tuffieħa</h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Time to take that well deserved break; put on your swimming garb, sunglasses and flip flops and head down to Għajn Tuffieħa. Forming part of Manikata village, it is an area in Mellieħa that is home to three popular bays- Għajn Tuffieħa, Golden Bay and Ġnejna. This particular bay is distinct, as before you actually get to the beach, you have to descend 200 steps (and if you're going down 200 steps, at some point, you have to climb up 200 steps). Yet do not be discouraged, as the cold, crystal clear sea and the red sands are worth the trip! Barbecues are allowed on this beach, so make an evening out of it! #seasunandfood </span><span style="font-weight:400;">🍔</span>

<h2><b>1 | The Black Sheep, Sliema</b></h2>

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">The island of Malta is rich in history, culture and tradition- elements which are found at the heart of every typical Maltese village, no less the tranquil village of Mellieħa. Mellieħa is a village situated on a hill, in the Northern region of Malta, and it is known for being one of the most tourist-friendly areas on the island. It is home to beaches, hotels, resorts and restaurants alike. This village has remained authentically and charmingly Maltese throughout the years, one can admire the hustle and bustle of the everyday life of the Mellieħa villagers, despite the large population of tourists residing in the area. </span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWcUkphAWr0/?taken-at=236259451

<span style="font-weight:400;">The name "Mellieħa" comes from the Maltese word "melħ", which in turn means salt. It is names after the ancient Roman salt pans found in Mellieħa Bay. However, this site is now occupied by the Għadira Nature Reserve; a bird sanctuary which temporarily homes over of 140 species of migrating birds which visit annually.  </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">It is a historically sacred village, as the area has been inhabited since the Neolithic times. One can spot several caves in the area, as well as tombs, and it is also home to the temple of Għajn Żejtuna, found closer to the coast. In addition, it is said that when St. Paul was shipwrecked in Malta, St. Luke, who was with St. Paul at the time, whilst exploring his surroundings, found himself in one of Mellieħa's caves and painted the figure of the Madonna on one of the cave's walls. Thus, this cave became a church, and  it has since been known as the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mellieħa. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">The sandy beaches are a definite attraction in this small town- Għadira is one of the most popular beaches in Malta, loved by locals and tourists alike. This is probably because of its vast area, consisting of a total of three beaches, separated by rocky areas, ideal for those who despise the sand. It has been awarded the Blue Flag Status, due to the fact that its waters are some of the cleanest in the island, and visibly so! The water is crystal clear, which is a definite advantage when it comes to spotting jellyfish. The beach ranges from shallow waters, providing safety for the kids, to deeper seas, great for snorkeling adventures.  The beach is laden with quality restaurants, kiosks, sunbeds and umbrellas, and all the amenities one might need to enjoy a relaxing day by the beach with family and friends. There are also lifeguards on site, making it one of the safest beaches on the island. Apart from Għadira, Mellieħa is also home to many other beaches: Paradise Bay, Armier and Little Armier, Golden Bay, Għajn Tuffieħa, Slugs Bay, and also Imġiebaħ Bay. The choices are endless!</span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWb9q6plysR/?taken-at=236259451

<span style="font-weight:400;">St. Agatha's Tower, or better known as The Red Tower, is visible from Għadira bay, due to its vibrant red colour. The watchtower's main purpose was to be used as a signalling post for communication between Malta and Gozo, and in the past, it was capable of housing over thirty soldiers. A visit is surely required, as the top of the tower offers spectacular views of the Mellieħa countryside, the beaches and can even offer a peak at Gozo. St. Agatha's tower was the last large bastioned tower to be built in the Maltese islands. </span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWW4oJXA3eJ/?taken-at=236259451

<span style="font-weight:400;">Another great feature of Mellieħa is Popeye Village, a filmset used in the 1980's Popeye movie, starring Robin Williams, that was kept after the production of the film ended. It has since become an entertainment park, great for an afternoon for families. It also offers all the facilities needed to make a day out of your visit- an on-site restaurant, beach facilities to swim in Anchor Bay, re-enactments by actors dressed up as Popeye characters and even a cinema!</span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWbBNpSl5tV/?taken-at=236259451

<span style="font-weight:400;">Naturally this village offers so much more- renowned restaurants, bars, pubs and karaoke bars, parks, gardens and even museums. It is a village that is treasured by all, and it is one which is worth the visit, and the stay. Look for lodging through Shortlets Malta ( follow the link here- </span><a href="http://shortletsmalta.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">http://shortletsmalta.com</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">) to find your perfect home, away from home. </span>

<h2><b>1. New York Best</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Situated in three locations: Msida, Paceville and Sliema, this place is hard to miss. Their menu is extensive to say the least; from breakfasts, to salads and wraps, to the more sinful varieties such as pizza and burgers, this place does it all. Their burgers are a force to be reckoned with- ranging from meats, to buttermilk chicken, all the way to veggie and falafel burgers, all served in a super soft brioche bun. This place will definitely satisfy your cravings! The restaurant is run by the Diacono brothers; self-professed foodies to the core. They vow to pay particular attention to using the best ingredients and to the detail in their food. And as their motto says; there's always time for New York Best!</span>

<h2><b>2. Fat Louie's</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Run by the Diacono brothers, the owners of New York Best, this restaurant took on new culinary experiences.

This burger is served on their famous brioche buns, and they are served with anchovy beurre noisette. They also have a black pudding burger served with crackling pork, and a bone marrow burger!

There are no addititives whatsoever, just a mix of secret herbs and spices, and onions! Fair warning though- these burgers are massive- it is a challenge to finish an entire burger in one sitting.

From truffle to blue cheese, these burgers are truly the crème de la crème. The place is Maltese run, and the staff is super friendly, yet places are limited, as this place is most sought after. It is best to book or wait for an available table. What's more- they offer the most indulgent pancakes on the island, oozing with chocolate and creams alike. They are worth every ounce of the sin! </span>

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If you're on holiday in Malta, and you fancy a holiday within a holiday, look no further. Fun Malta offers you the Sicily Tour, a one day trip of a lifetime. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Sicily happens to be the largest island within the Mediterranean Sea,  surrounded by other smaller  yet equally beautiful islands. It is home to Mount Etna, Europe’s tallest active volcano, at 3,329 m (10,922 ft) high.  This captivating island offers its tourists the best experience an island can offer, panoramic beaches, immeasurable landscapes, a mild climate and a cuisine which is to die for. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">When touring with Fun Malta, one can choose between two types of tours- the Taormina and Mount Etna One Day Tour, and a relaxing Culture, History and Gastronomic Tour.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2890" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/italy-taormina-sicilian-market-italian-sicily-2476286.jpg" alt="Italy-Taormina-Sicilian-Market-Italian-Sicily-2476286.jpg" width="960" height="704" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">The first Tour option will take you for a visit to “Il Comune di Taormina”, a municipality in the city of Messina, found on the side of a mountain, guaranteed to offer its visitors a “dolce vita” experience. It is the perfect location for a relaxing, carefree holiday, as the area is laden with restaurants, cafe’s, beaches and boutiques- a perfect getaway from the busy everyday life. It is home to the “Teatro Greco”, a horse-shoe shaped Greek Theatre built in 300 BC, and it is the second largest Greek Theatre in Sicily. It sometimes hosts international arts and film exhibitions. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2892" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maxpixel-freegreatpicture-com-mediterranean-italy-sicily-historic-architecture-2223066.jpg" alt="MaxPixel.freegreatpicture.com-Mediterranean-Italy-Sicily-Historic-Architecture-2223066.jpg" width="1920" height="709" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">The Taormina and Mount Etna tour will also take you to Corso Umberto, the main street of Taormina, a pedestrian zone filled with boutiques and culture. One may visit Piazza IX Aprile, which offers magnificent views and its very own Chiesa San Giuseppe. There's also the famous Torre dell'Orologio, a 12</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> century clock-tower, which leads to Piazza del Duomo, where one can admire a fountain, dated back to 1635, that exhibits the symbol of Taormina; a centaur with the bust of an angel. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2894" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maxpixel-freegreatpicture-com-flowers-piazza-checkerboard-taormina-square-italy-2059115.jpg" alt="MaxPixel.freegreatpicture.com-Flowers-Piazza-Checkerboard-Taormina-Square-Italy-2059115.jpg" width="1920" height="1324" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">To conclude the day with a bang, the tour will take you through a climb to Mount Etna, guaranteeing panoramic views of villages, forests, the local agriculture, vineyards and orchards, ultimately leading to the volcanic plains of Mount Etna. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2896" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/etna-140103_1920.jpg" alt="etna-140103_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1440" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">The Culture, History and Gastronomic Tour is an entirely different experience altogether, yet one will find that it is just as wonderful. Ideal for all history aficionados, this tour will guide you through the three ancient cities of Noto, Marzamemi and Syracuse. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2898" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maxpixel-freegreatpicture-com-church-baroque-cathedral-sicily-noto-italy-1912944.jpg" alt="MaxPixel.freegreatpicture.com-Church-Baroque-Cathedral-Sicily-Noto-Italy-1912944.jpg" width="1920" height="1280" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Noto is a city close to Syracuse, home to the Noto Cathedral, a church which has been declared to be a UNESCO World Heritage site. The entire city is a fine example of the Sicilian Baroque architectural style. On the other hand, Marzamemi is a seas-side village known for its fishing culture, mainly the tuna-fishing variety. It is also known for its artisanal produce, namely dried or canned tuna, smoked fish, marinated anchovies and condiments- a seafood lover's dream! It is also conveniently nearby to the sandy beach of Porto Palo di Capo Passero. </span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2900" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/nun-643167_1920.jpg" alt="nun-643167_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1276" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Finally, this tour will end in Syracuse, a city which is bursting with Greek history, cultures, amphitheaters and architecture, including the Temple of Apollo, the Fountain of Arethusa and its very own Greek Theatre. It is also the birthplace of the acclaimed mathematician and engineer Archimedes. This city is also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its fundamentally rich history. One will also be able to experience an inclusive traditional Sicilian lunch, to get a real sense of what it is like to be Sicilian. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">It is truly hard to choose between both tours, but whichever you end up choosing, the ultimate Sicilian experience is definitely guaranteed.

            [blog_content] => What is it about a Maltese summer that has thousands of tourists and travellers flocking to this side of the Mediterranean each year? Some visitors love our sun-kissed island so much, they never leave and decide to make Malta or Gozo their permanent home! So let’s take a cheeky look at just 7 top reasons to make Malta you summer destination:
<h2><b>1 | Serious Summer Weather</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you’re looking for days drenched in golden sunshine, then Malta’s definitely the place to be. With  around eight months of sunshine a year, you’ll be going back home with the most enviable of tans! Remember to take care of your skin and drink lots of water, because the UV index can get a little high over here, and the last thing you want to do is end up looking like a lobster. </span>

<h2><b>2 | Beautiful Beaches</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">With all that glorious sun, you </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">know </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">we need some equally-excellent beaches, right? You’ll never be far from the sea, so take your pick - sandy or rocky, north, central, or south, we’ve got a pretty good selection in store for you. </span>

<h2><b>3 | Ridiculously Rich History</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The Maltese Islands saw their first settlers around 5200 BC, when stone age farmers and hunters came over from Sicily. Since then, a </span><b>lot </b><span style="font-weight:400;">has happened on these tiny islands; from the awe-inspiring Megalithic temples, to Phoenician, Roman, Arabic, Byzantine, Norman, French, and British rule and beyond! If you love being immersed in century upon century of history, look no further. </span>

<h2><b>4 | Gorgeous Gozo</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">No trip to Malta can ever be complete without spending at least one day on our sister island, Gozo! With a typically-Mediterranean vibe and breath-taking sights to see, you’ll be charmed in an instant. </span>

<h2><b>5 | Buzzing Nightlife</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta’s two entertainment hotspots, St. Julian’s and Paceville, as bursting with all the clubs, pubs, lounges, and restaurants you could need during your time here. For something little more laid back, hit Valletta and enjoy a night out surrounded by our capital’s regal beauty! </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/wAxlCmeX1ri1y/giphy.webp" />
<h2><b>6 | English is Everywhere</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Almost every Maltese person alive can speak three languages: English, Maltese, and Italian. That means you probably don’t need to worry about any language barriers, but when in doubt - talk with your hands, just like the locals! </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/l2YWmJXKo7imjqhxu/giphy.webp" />
<h2><b>7 | Endless Fun</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta may be small in size, but it’s BIG on fun. You’ll always have something new and exciting to do, from <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scuba diving</a> and <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cruising around Comino</a> to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horse riding</a>, <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/kayaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kayaking</a>, and more!  </span>

            [blog_content] => <span lang="en-US">Valletta, or ‘Il-Belt’ (The City), is loved by locals and tourists alike - but what makes this great walled city so popular? A quick look online will reward you with countless photos showing off our capital city’s incredible beauty, but let’s take a closer look at why so many people want to make Valletta their home!</span>
<h2>1. Stunning Architecture</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BMr8BXEAybN/?taken-by=arguablykelly
<span lang="en-US">Living in Valletta means being treated to beautiful buildings and little architectural quirks are every turn. Described as an ‘architectural jewel’, the 2018 European Capital of Culture is a living treasure chest filled with majestic baroque buildings, imposing fortifications built by the Knights of St. John, and enchanting churches, to name just a few highlights.</span>

<h2>2. Entertainment Haven</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/1NokvZqRzB/?taken-at=418542981
<span lang="en-US">You’ll never be short of something to do here - whether you’re in the mood for some fine dining or just want to enjoy an aperitif with your besties, you’re sure to find something to suit you. When it comes to finding the right place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, or drinks, you’ll be spoilt for choice in Valletta!</span>

<h2>3. Drama Central</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BAVWHnqrbP3/?tagged=teatrumanoel
<span lang="en-US">We mean theatre, of course! Valletta is home to the Manoel Theatre, the Royal Opera House (in ruins, recently converted into an open-air venue), and St. James Cavalier, a creative space where you can enjoy art exhibitions, less mainstream films, and live-streamed performance from the Royal Shakespeare Company, for example. If you love the arts, this is definitely the city for you. </span>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BWgebVchA2U/
<h2>4. Stunning Views</h2>
<span lang="en-US">A view of Valletta’s sweeping skyline is pretty tough to beat, day or night! That being said, you’ll find loads of gorgeous scenery all over the city. Our favourite view right now has to be the Grand Harbour, seen from the Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens!</span>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvEnfwAdIp/
<h2>5. Centuries of History</h2>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUferUrh41c/
<span lang="en-US">Around 1524, the Knights of the Order of St. John were proposed that a city should be built on the strategically-positioned Sciberras Peninsula. It was Grand Master Jean de Valette who gave the city its name and overall plan, and the rest is (literally) history! The city is alive with century upon century of history, from the opulent auberges and churches to its regal bastions, enduring fortifications, and beyond - you’ll find yourself falling in love with the place you call home every day.</span>

            [blog_content] => <span lang="en-US">It’s no secret - summer in the Mediterranean is pretty amazing. What's not to love? The long, sun-drenched days melt away into fiery sunsets and cool yet lively nights, and time spent relaxing isn’t just accepted, but actively encouraged by the locals. So what’s the best way to cool down when you’re visiting our gem of an island this summer? Here are just a few ideas to get things started!</span>

<h3 align="LEFT"><span lang="en-US"><b>1 | <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/snorkeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snorkeling</a> and <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scuba Diving</a></b></span></h3>
<span lang="en-US">When you’re surrounded by gentle blue waves as far as the eye can see, it’s basically </span><span lang="en-US"><i>impossible </i></span><span lang="en-US"> to resist going for a dip. Snorkeling or scuba diving are two great ways to keep cool while you get up close and personal with the real ‘locals’ underwater. Grab your goggles and a set of flippers and get ready to be immersed in a cyan-coloured world so magical, you’l forget you live on land.</span>

            [blog_content] => Comino is Malta and Gozo's (little) sister island, situated right in between both islands, and being 3.5 square kilometers in area, she sure is tiny. However, she is none the less beautiful, some even preferring her to her sisters. Below are six reasons why you should <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book a Comino and Blue Lagoon Cruise with Fun Malta</a>, today!
<h2>1. It is almost uninhabited</h2>
Fun fact: the island of Comino is home to only three residents, the fourth having passed away in 2017, making it virtually uninhabited. This gives you ample space to explore the island on foot or on bike; the garrigue wilderness, the rocky cliffs, all the beaches and caves that the island has to offer. You will notice that it is a totally different atmosphere from Malta and Gozo's- there's a minimal amount of cars, buildings or anything in between, and the entire island is a protected nature reserve and bird sanctuary, making it a welcome change from the hectic everyday life of Malta.

<h2>2. The Blue Lagoon</h2>
This is Comino's main attraction- a teal stretch of water connecting Comino with Cominotto. The waters are clear and the sand is white- a beautiful background for a relaxing day by the sea. Swimming to Cominotto is easy and manageable, if not totally enjoyable. There is a kiosk, facilities, sunbeds and umbrellas available for rent at the beach. However, the beach gets busy during the better part of the day, making <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fun Malta's Comino and Blue Lagoon Cruises</a> ideal- you can lie on the beach or stay on the boat, which will be anchored at the bay, therefore all facilities, including food and drink, showers and air-conditioned areas are available to all guests.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXEMqpfgqUr/?tagged=comino
<h2>3. It is great for Snorkeling</h2>
The warm, clear water and the secluded cloves make the waters of Comino the perfect place for snorkeling amateurs and professionals alike. The area around the Blue Lagoon is full of underwater caves, rich in marine life, making it an unforgettable experience. Cominotto and its surrounding areas are also home to a coral reef, whilst the Santa Marija Cave is laden with shoals of bream, however, for this particular activity, one must organise an excursion with a diving centre in Malta or Gozo, as it is not accessible by land.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXCwU8WHZzg/?tagged=comino
<h2>4. St Mary's Tower</h2>
This tower is the most prominent feature of the island, being the easiest to spot from a distance. The story behind this tower is interesting enough to warrant a visit; in 1416, the Maltese people petitioned their king at the time, Alfonso V of Aragon, to serve as a warning system against the Turks, pirates and corsairs who had taken to hiding in Comino and using the ground to attack the other islands. The King agreed, thus he raised taxes on wine to raise the funds for the tower, however, he decided to keep the money for himself, thus leaving the island undefended. It was the Knights of Malta, or more specifically, Grandmaster Wignacourt, who finally made the Maltese citizen's wishes come true, two hundred years later.

<h2>5. Comino is almost a Celebrity</h2>
The island, with all its fine scenery and shades of blue, was used in popular movies like Troy, The Count of Monte Cristo and Swept Away.  This comes as no surprise- the island is peaceful, unencumbered and untouched by the building frenzy, making it the perfect setting for any Roman, Medieval or your typical "stranded on an island" movie. So follow the likes of Brad Pitt, Guy Pearce and even Madonna, and visit this magical island.

            [blog_content] => Sliema is a coastal town located in the Northern region of Malta, overlooking the capital city, Valletta. Along the Sliema seafront, you will find the neighbouring town of St. Julians. Although neighbouring, both towns serve different purposes- whilst Sliema showcases the "dolce vita", with leisure activities such as beaches, shopping, cafés, and sea views, St. Julians is a vibrant burst of party life, bars and restaurants, making the fact that they are so closely connected an advantage to locals and tourists alike. Talk about having the best of both worlds!

Start your day the Maltese way- have a "te' u pastizzi" (tea and pastizzi- almost a Maltese delicacy) at Giorgio's café, overlooking the Sliema Ferries. Giorgio's is one of the first cafés to ever grace the town of Sliema, therefore it is only fitting that one should start their day there! It is found right at the corner of Bisazza street, a pedestrian street full of shops and boutiques, yet it boasts of excellent views of the coming and goings of the ferries and <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harbour cruises</a> available at Sliema Ferries. It is the perfect way to observe the hustle and bustle of Sliema, as although the town's namesake means "peace", it happens to be one of Malta's busiest towns.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BQIKpKDjjf_/?taken-by=giorgioscafeboutique

Spend the rest of the morning at the beach- Sliema, being a coastal town, boasts of a variety of clean yet rocky beaches, with sunny and shaded areas alike, along the sea front. Some notable swimming areas are Tigne, Surfside, Exiles and Qui-Si Sana- all safe, clean and equipped with ladders, with flat areas ideal for sunbathing. You could also opt to take a <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harbour cruise around Sliema and Valletta</a>- a great experience for all the family.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXPhiFPFSnD/?taken-at=215986867

For lunch, the options in Sliema are endless, and able to suit every individual's needs. For those who are health conscious, yet won't compromise their tastebuds' enjoyment, Mint (opposite Surfside) is the ideal option- boasting of freshly prepared, vegetable based, vegetarian or vegan dishes. If you're in the mood for some typical Maltese cuisine, head over to Ta' Kris, a tiny yet charming restaurant that will definitely impress. If you are looking for lunch on a budget, look for Il-Gabbana, a café located on the Sliema Waterfront, opposite Surfside, or Tony's Bar, a British pub style café opposite the Sliema Ferries.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BCAvIMqAyhG/?taken-by=ilgabbana

If you want to avoid the harsh sun in the afternoon, make your way towards The Point, Sliema's largest shopping mall, for some shopping and relaxation. For those who like to shop, The Point offers many different stores, from high end, to high street- your needs and wants are very likely to be met! One will find clothing stores, make up stores, shoe stores, perfumeries, "tech" shops, sport shops, a kitchenwear store... the list is endless! And if shopping really, really, <i>really </i>isn't your thing, head over to JAR, ground level, for the best milkshake of your life.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWVwp2PB2Sm/?taken-by=jar_malta

Of. Your. Life.

In the evening, it's a no-brainer; the only place to go to is St. Julians. If the weather permits/ if you have enough energy after such a long day of bliss and relaxation, you can walk to St, Julians following the Sliema seafront. If not, buses are readily available, with a bus stop within walking distance from anywhere you are currently situated in Sliema. St. Julians, in the evening, is colourful and vibrant- there will always be something to do, somewhere to go or something to see.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXRDrQDgdhq/?taken-at=3798792

St. Julians is home to Paceville, a party village overflowing with clubs, bars and restaurants. If you are feeling adventurous, start your evening with happy hour from Soho lounge, situated at the heart of Paceville. If, however, you are looking for quiet, quality fine dining, look no further than Caviar and Bull- a nationally and internationally renowned restaurant. Alternatively, if you cannot get enough of Maltese cuisine, head over to Gululu, located by the waterfront of St Julians.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BV8tKhUhN19/?taken-at=946043354

If you are still wild at heart, it is now time to club. Grab your friends and walk over to Havana club, the home of Ramp;B, or Bar Native, for some Latin music. The choices are vast and endless, see where the night takes you!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWv7ConjIj0/?taken-at=222911417

After a day like this, it is hard not to go back to these towns. There are so many things to do in both Sliema and St. Julians, that if you <i>do </i>decide to go back, the experience will always be most satisfying.

            [blog_content] => Malta’s sister island, Gozo, is so beautiful that Maltesers and tourists alike love to escape there for weekend breaks or day trips to enjoy its idyllic beaches and laid-back vibe. No trip to Malta is complete without spending at least a day in Gozo, so here are just 6 things to help get you started on your Gozitan adventure!
<h2><b>1 | Swim at Ramla l-Hamra</b></h2>
Ramla l-Hamra (‘The Red Sandy Beach’) is a gorgeous stretch of beach located on the north-eastern side of the island. Be sure to take an umbrella and layer on the sun block, because you won’t want to leave this slice of paradise.

<h2><b>2 | Eat (and drink) Well </b></h2>
Gozo may be even smaller than Malta, but make no mistake - it’s BIG on food. We could list loads of must-try restaurants and eateries dotted around the island, but here are a few top picks that’ll have you covered when you get hungry: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tmunmgarr/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It-Tmun</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/tmunmgarr/?ref=br_rs -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/162669017117957/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ta’ Karolina</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/groups/162669017117957/?ref=br_rs -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MaxokkBakery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxokk</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/MaxokkBakery/ -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/countryterraceGozo/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Country Terrace</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/countryterraceGozo/?ref=br_rs -->, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lastanzarestaurant/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Stanza</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/lastanzarestaurant/?ref=br_rs  -->, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Boathouse-Group-604438609588106/?ref=br_rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Boat House</a><!-- https://www.facebook.com/The-Boathouse-Group-604438609588106/?ref=br_rs -->.

<h2><b>3 | Visit Ta’ Pinu</b></h2>
Known to locals simply as ‘Ta’ Pinu’, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Blessed Virgin of Ta’ Pinu (say that fast, ten times) is an enchanting minor basilica and shrine that becomes all the more magical around sunset.

<h2><b>4 | Snap some photos around Dwejra </b></h2>
Even without the awe-inspiring Azure Window standing tall, Dwejra is still totally worth a visit! Take in the rugged landscapes and watch the waves roll against the time-worn rocks before you walk down to enjoy a drink at one of the quaint, colourful little bars by the inland sea.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BWnYLjKAIPf/?taken-at=254920783
<h2><b>5 | Take a Jeep Tour </b></h2>
If you want to see as much as possible in one action-packed day, then why not take a <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-jeep-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jeep tour of Gozo</a><!-- Link to funmalta jeep tour  -->? This is probably the best and most effective way to discover some of the island’s most breath-taking sights, with plenty of time to snap as many photos as you like.

<h2><b>6 | Wander around Cittadella </b></h2>
The Cittadella is a regal walled city that watches over Victoria and offers some truly unbeatable views. Walk through the city gate and step back in time as you explore this gorgeous piece of Gozitan history, and end your visit with a chilled drink at Café San Martino.

            [blog_content] => Summer in Malta is known for a multitude of things- beaches, concerts, <i>unbearable </i>heat (I’m talking about you, heatwave ‘Lucifer’), but among the locals, summer usually indicates one thing- village festas. They are held on particular dates between the months of May and September. Love them or hate them, they happen; fireworks, festoons, flags, petards, all for the celebration of the village’s patron saint.

Each festa is usually held around the perimeters of the parish church of the village. The streets are decorated with columns, festoons, lights and flags, hung upon the houses that surround the parish church. The food stalls sell traditional Maltese nougat, <i>mqaret</i> (fried date cakes) and <i>those </i>amazingly oily sweet jam donuts “tal-festa”.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xGNYX8nPHc90I/giphy.gif" alt=" movie crying god mindy kaling donut GIF" />

Much needed cold beer is passed around from the outside bars found on the edge of the street, and paper mache statues that join the crowds, as hundreds of villagers swarm the area as the festivities begin. The local <i>banda, </i>a village band, competes with the sounds of the fireworks bursting into colourful displays. The band performs local favourites, and everyone sings along, whilst the crowd follows the band around the streets of the village, spreading the cheer.

The local celebrity eventually comes out to meet the crowds- that is, the ginormous statue of the patron saint, that a chosen number of people carry on their backs, whilst the adoring crowd cheers them on. After that, an exhibition of the <i>ġigġifogu, </i>or pinwheels, mesmerizes the crowds, crowning the end of the street festa. After parties are usually held at the local bar, or <i>każin. </i>

Funnily enough, some Maltese festas carry the same name, even though they are held in different villages. This is because different villages sometimes have the same patron saint. This is also where some villagers get competitive with others, constantly bickering about which festa is the most elaborate and spectacular, due to how dedicated and passionate they are about their village feast. In August alone, there are 11 Feasts of the Assumption of our Lady, celebrated in Mqabba (13th-15th of August), Victoria (Gozo) (15th August), Qrendi (15th August), Mosta (15th August), Gudja (15th August), Ħal-Ghaxaq (15th August), Attard (15th August), Ħad-Dingli (15th August), Mġarr (18th August) and Żebbuġ (Gozo) (18th August). There are so many happening within the span of a week, so take your pick!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BW3G1VoFJWI/?tagged=maltafesta

Some great feasts to follow are the Feast of Stella Maris, which is held in Sliema on the 18th till the 20th of August, the Feast of St, Dominic in Birgu, held on the 25th till the 27th of August, and the Feast of St Julian, held on the 25th till the 27th of August. The festas drag on for three days, therefore, when different festas occur on the same day, it is more than possible to visit a different village festa each day.

In September, the festivities continue. On the 1st of September, until the 4th, Sliema will be celebrating the Feast of St Gregory, whilst Żurrieq will be celebrating the Feast of St. Catherine. It is highly recommended that you visit Mellieħa for the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lady and “Il- Vitorja”, throughout the week of the 1st of September to the 8th of September, where the two Mellieħa band clubs, the Imperial band club and La Vittoria Philharmonic society, will be marching along the streets of Mellieħa. All the local restaurants are open, shows and parades are held in the streets, and the firework displays across the Mellieħa landscapes are a sight to behold.

Take an opportunity to really integrate with the village locals, and celebrate their most anticipated day of the year with them, as some cherish their village festa more than their actual birthday! It is an experience not to be missed, and integral part of what it really means to be Maltese.

            [blog_content] => Magic is something that was ever-present in our childhood, but less so in our adulthood. From Disney movies, to television series like Bewitched, and finally, Harry Potter- who hasn’t been mesmerized by the idea of magic?

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pI2paNxecnUNW/giphy.gif" alt=" harry potter magic hermione granger ronald weasley hprewatch GIF" />

Magic has been around for centuries, it is known as one of the oldest and most sought-after genres of performing arts in history, where audiences were entertained for hours by card tricks, optical illusions and well-staged rituals. By time, the tricks performed became more elaborate- from pulling a rabbit out of a hat (nonetheless a classic, in my opinion), to escaping from a set of handcuffs whilst trapped in a tank full of water (The Prestige, anyone?).

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6enFRY6UGLpJe/giphy.gif" alt=" movie christian bale christopher nolan the prestige GIF" />

Luckily for all of us dreamers, magic is still very much alive in 2017, and can be found in Malta! Bring your friends and family to the notorious Chamber of Mysteries in the heart of Malta, Qormi. The venue is a traditional Maltese farmhouse called Razzett l-Antik (the old farmhouse), built by the Knights of St John in 1743, the ideal venue to give you that traditional Maltese feeling. It is said to be the secret venue where old wizards used to meet in the past, to perform their magical rituals, hence the name “Chamber of Mysteries”. However, the main building was once utilised as a milling factory, which is why Razzett l-Antik is dedicated to the best Maltese cuisine can offer.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohfFr0PcMTsonsgb6/giphy.gif" alt="Twin Peaks on Showtime season 1 episode 5 twin peaks showtime GIF" />

The night consists of an all-inclusive buffet dinner, featuring purely traditional Maltese cuisine, free-flowing wine, soft-drinks and water, and the highlight of the evening- a magic show featuring the award-winning magician Brian Role’, accompanied by the beautiful and talented Lola Palmer. Get ready for a night of mind-blowing magical illusions, levitation, mind-reading acts, and even floating objects, accompanied by some witty humour and performances that defy all logical explanations- the true art of magic. </span>

<h3></h3>
<h3><b>1. Żmerc, Attard</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This bar is an absolute favourite of all; those who have only just discovered alcohol (legally) and those who are older and wiser, who only come down for a pint or two with friends. Its versatility, combined with a friendly, enthusiastic atmosphere, makes for the perfect “change of scenery” from the bars and clubs of Paceville. In addition, this bar provides nibbles on the house and a full menu for the hungrier clientele, which is always a bonus when out drinking! </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3osxYfo1Y0NtKdYJi0/giphy.gif" alt="Warner Archive drink classic film drinks gin GIF" />
<h3><b>2. City Bar, Mosta</b></h3>

Dimly lit and respectfully quiet, this place is perfect for those winter nights when the craving for something strong to warm you up is ever-present. Great for group outings or romantic wine dates, this place also offers platters and meals, to keep that sobriety going. </span>

<h3><b>3. Del Borgo, Birgu</b></h3>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BTe_6_gFB7h/?tagged=delborgo

<span style="font-weight:400;">This gem of a bar is hidden in the lonely streets of Birgu (Citta’ Vittoriosa), one of the Three Cities. Yet don’t be fooled by the antiquity and silence this beauty of a town has to offer, as the fun begins and ends in Del Borgo. Set in a traditionally Maltese “house of character”, the atmosphere in this bar encourages you to drink and relax, whilst the exquisite menu entices you to order almost everything they have to offer. If a heavy meal is not what you’re looking for, platters made to perfectly accompany your wine are available. A true hidden treasure!</span>
<h3><b>4. The Fortress, Xemxija </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Overlooking the Xemxija and St. Paul’s bay, this place is the perfect summer hangout.

<h3><b>5. StrEAT  Whiskey amp; Bistro, Valletta</b></h3>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BU7DMphgELR/?taken-by=streatwhisky

<span style="font-weight:400;">This is the perfect excuse to visit our capital city (just in case you actually </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">need </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">an excuse to go to Valletta), this bar can be found in one of Valletta’s many narrow side roads, particularly in this case, Strada Stretta (Strait Street). This road is famously known for its history as the epitome of Maltese nightlife back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where British and American militants mingled and co-existed with the Maltese frequenters. If you feel the need to keep this tradition alive, head over to StrEAT (yes, with a capital EAT, as it should be), for a whisky, a bottle of wine and a platter. The nostalgic atmosphere will certainly encourage you to return! </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/uYcuStWfBtHnW/giphy.gif" alt=" tv wine megan mullally karen walker will grace GIF" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Having said all the above (and almost encouraged our dear readers to get intoxicated this weekend), please drink and drive responsibly. Assign a designated driver, travel by bus or taxi, or stick to the threshold designed by Maltese law (0.8mg of alcohol per ml of blood or 35mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath). Either way, enjoy responsibly! </span>

            [blog_content] => The Three Cities are known individually as Cospicua, Senglea and Vittoriosa, yet locals known them by other names; “Bormla”, “l-Isla” and “il-Birgu”, respectively. These cities have, in time, settled into quiet traditionally authentic Maltese villages, yet in the past they were not only regarded as homes, but as crucial fortresses of the island, to almost all the natives at the time.

These harbours have been in use since Phoenician times, providing the locals with work and opportunities to trade, yet they left the villagers vulnerable in times of war. However, when the Order of St. John first arrived in Malta, they took the Three Cities under their wing and fortified them, whilst building the palaces and churches that are still standing to this day, giving the cities their grandiose and classical feel. Since the Order settled within the Three Cities before moving onto Valletta, we can say that they are older than the capital city itself.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3210" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/malta-1910173_960_720.jpg" alt="malta-1910173_960_720.jpg" width="960" height="640" />

Out of all three cities, Birgu happens to be the oldest, as its activity dates back to the Middle Ages; any ruler hoping to obtain leadership of Malta had to first conquer Birgu due to its crucial position in the Grand Harbour. It is found in the Southeastern region of Malta, with Fort Saint Angelo at its head. The city boasts of a very long history with maritime, mercantile and military activities. Once the Order of St. John arrived in Malta, Birgu was made capital city of the island, and Mdina was removed of its title, due to the fact that Mdina was not a harbour city, therefore could not suit the Order’s naval needs.

Birgu was in the spotlight during the Great Siege of 1565, and due to the Knights’ newly built fortresses and defence tactics, Malta was not conquered by the Ottoman Empire. This victory is what inspired Birgu’s title, “Citta’ Vittoriosa”. Unfortunately, Birgu was heavily bombed during World War II, due to its proximity to the Malta Dockyard, and a number of historical buildings emanating from the era of the Knights were destroyed, including the Birgu Clock Tower.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3212 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/flag-116590_960_720.jpg" alt="flag-116590_960_720" width="960" height="720" />

Nowadays, Birgu is growing in popularity, due to its quiet disposition and the Birgufest, which is takes place in October. During Birgufest, the city is lit by candlelight, to enhance the historic and architectural beauty of the city.

Senglea, or rather, “l-Isla”, is Birgu’s fortified neighbour, and is also known as Citta’ Invicta, due to the fact that it had remained unconquered in the resistance of the invasion from the Ottoman Empire. However, its other name “Senglea” is derived from the Grand Master who was in charge of its reconstruction; Claude de la Sengle. St. Julian’s Church was the first founding building constructed in the area, more precisely in 1311, when it was known as Isola di San Giuliano or Isola di San Michele and not Senglea. It was heavily affected by the plague in the late 1600s, and narrowly evaded another outbreak in 1813. The villagers erected the statue of Our Lady in the city centre, as a sign of gratitude for the protection of the villagers.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3217 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/malta-96971_960_720.jpg" alt="malta-96971_960_720.jpg" width="480" height="720" />

It was also heavily bombed during the second World War, by a blitz by the Luftwaffe on HMS Illustrious; many villagers were killed and the city lost its Basilica. The devastated site was later visited by King George VI, the father of Queen Elisabeth II, and almost fifty years later, by Pope John Paul II. On the 50th anniversary of the blitz, a monument which honours the local victims of both World Wars was unveiled besides the Basilica on the 5th September 1991. In 2001, Senglea won a European Destinations of Excellence Award for aquatic tourism.

Lastly, Cospicua, or “Bormla” also has a third title- Civitas Cospicua. The name “Bormla” comes from Bir Mula, which translates into “well of the Lord”. This double-fortified city is the most densely populated city out of the three, boasting almost 6,000 inhabitants. Bormla has been inhabited since Neolithic times, and its maritime use dates back to 600BC. The Order of St John took roughly 70 years to complete the fortifications of the city, and it was only declared a city by Grand Master Marc’Antonio Zondadari, in 1722. The dockyard constructed by the Order was consequently used by the British Royal Navy during their rule, and was proven to be particularly useful during the Crimean war and the First World War.

Cospicua celebrates its well known feast on the 8th of December, in honour of the Immaculate Conception, and it’s also known for its Good Friday procession, a popular tourist attraction.

These cities remain largely unvisited by locals and tourists alike. However, take a chance and book the “Two Harbours Cruise”  tour with Fun Malta (follow this link: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise">https://www.funmalta.com/2-harbours-cruise</a>). You will be truly amazed by the wonders these cities have to offer.

            [blog_content] => As the 21st of September is rolling by, we want to celebrate the anniversary of our independence from the British rule, and more particularly, our uniqueness- there’s no other nation like us.

Face it, you love us. From the way we wake you up at 6am with our church bells, to the random “IL-LAMPUKI!” or “TAL-BIGILLA” screams in the middle of the road. We’re adorable.The Maltese people are the embodiment of Mediterranean temperament; everything we say, everything we do, is done with passion and joie de vivre. We understand why you’d want to be more like us, so here are seven tips and tricks to help you integrate with our nation.
<h3>1. Waking up with a “te’ fit-tazza” and a “pastizz”;</h3>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jKaFXbKyZFja0/giphy.gif" alt=" gif food excited hungry sushi GIF" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">We don’t all drink tea in a glass and eat “pastizzi” everyday, but this is truly the breakfast that makes us feel patriotic from the get go. Super indulgent, comfortingly soft and easy on the wallet. You’re so welcome. And yes, okay, it is very high in calories, but that only means that there will be more of us (and you) to love.</span>

<h3>2. Learning these phrases;</h3>
We’ve all been through it; that random lady starting a conversation on the bus, most of the time, in Maltese. What do you do?
<ol>
	<li>a) Panic,</li>
	<li>b) Get off the bus, or</li>
	<li>c) Fake it till you make it?</li>
</ol>
We’ve taken the liberty of choosing option c) for you, and with these phrases, you’re bound to ace any conversation in Maltese

“Mela”- meaning “of course” “granted” “you are absolutely right”

“Istra”- meaning “wow I’m impressed by what you are saying”

“Jaħasra/ Miskina”- meaning “I empathise with you, storyteller”

“Ċaw!”- meaning “bye!”, for when the storyteller departs.

<h3>3. Going to Gozo for a holiday;</h3>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/i1hiQy3uVZ0KQ/giphy.gif" alt=" parks and recreation parks and rec retta donna meagle self care GIF" />

Also known as the ideal staycation, or the holiday (a few kilometers) away from home. Our foreign counterparts laugh at us, however there’s nothing more relaxing that visiting Malta 2.0; the natural, quiet, hustle and bustle free Malta, predominantly known as Gozo. You see, we love our country so much, we ask ourselves, “What’s better that going on holiday in our own country?”. And the truth is nothing. Nothing is better. Gozo is clean, fresh, a true weekend break. You know it’s hard to resist.

<h3>4. Complaining about “long” “far away” journeys...in Malta;</h3>
You could possibly come from a country where the nearest Mcdonalds is about an hour’s drive away, so the fifteen minute car ride from St. Julians to Valletta might seem like a dream to you. For us, anything longer than 30 minutes is a total and utter nightmare.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif0C9va5XEfwrL2/giphy.gif" alt="The Hills driving the hills traffic 1x05 GIF" />

And the parking? Let’s not even go there.
<h3>5. Going to the Village Festa;</h3>
Put on your village “colour”, grab a cold six pack of Cisk and head over to the Village square for a night of music, loud singing, junk food and band marches. Every year we become very patriotic, somewhat religious, and proud of our Village festa, then we forget all about it, but the point is that we will welcome you to our festa with open arms, and we’ll even offer you a beer and a sing along!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BX09gsyH0fK/?tagged=maltesefesta

Of course that only accounts for half the Maltese population. The other half complains about late-night fireworks, loud music, littering and (you’ve guessed it) the lack of parking around the village, on facebook.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HIYW8sTRTHt1m/giphy.gif" alt=" keyboard GIF" />
<h3>6. Letting the weather predict if you’re going out tonight</h3>
The first rain as summer starts coming to an end always brings about floods, relief (because now you have a good excuse not to wash your car), excitement (no more heatwaves...perhaps?) and...facebook posts, alerting the Maltese nation that yes, it’s raining, just in case you can’t hear the rain beat down on your office windows.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gRnSZSRzOJeG4/giphy.gif" alt=" rain window rainy day GIF" />

However, the real Malteser (not the candy) element here, is the fact that we are somewhat genetically predisposed to being afraid of going out in the rain. Understandably so. Malta’s roads flood ever so easily- it is of no surprise that cars tend to break down easily during the rainy season. And obviously there’s our hair- those weekly hairdresser blowdries don’t come cheap, you know. Stay in, make a tazza te’, and enjoy the weather.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6T7lPSMHpNdle/giphy.gif" alt=" sad pokemon rain raining charmander GIF" />
<h3>7. Bringing a three course meal, wherever we go;</h3>
Are we going to the beach? Let’s pack a lunch. Work? Pack a lunch. Picnic? Pack a lunch. Cinema? Pack a lunch (in all fairness, cinema snacks are overpriced, so mum might have a point here).

And when we say lunch, we don’t mean a light sandwich. We mean “just in case you need to feed yourself and 30 of your  friends” lunch. We don’t follow the “eat until you’re not hungry” rule- we follow the “eat until you tear the seams of your jeans” rule. Explains a lot, doesn’t it?

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/7cByCwKMbILLi/giphy.gif" alt=" lunch GIF" />

The “more to love” rule also applies here.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/oWjyixDbWuAk8/giphy.gif" alt=" simpsons couch join us one of us imgurians GIF" />

We cannot guarantee a passport, but what we can guarantee is that now you really are one of us.

<h3>3. <span lang="en-US"><b>And it’ll tone your core! </b></span></h3>

            [blog_content] => Mosta is a traditional Maltese town, constantly developing and re-inventing itself, keeping up to date with the modern exigencies of its inhabitants. However, Mosta is also considered a highly historical and cultural town, renowned mainly for two things; the Rotunda and its urban legends.

The “Rotunda” of Mosta (formally known as the Parish Church of the Assumption) boasts of its status as the third largest unsupported dome in Europe. Construction on the church started in 1833, its round shape based on the Pantheon in Rome. The church is said to be of miraculous properties; during World War II, a 500kg highly explosive bomb fell into the church during mass, yet it did not explode. Not only did this miracle save hundreds of lives, but it also saved the integrity of the beloved Church. Currently, a similar bomb is now displayed in the sacristy at the back of the church, under the words "The Bomb Miracle, 9 April 1942".

Mosta’s most famous folktale <i>and </i>ballad, known to all of its inhabitants, young and old, must be the “Bride of Mosta”, or more commonly known in Maltese, “l-Għarusa tal-Mosta”. This legend introduces our heroine, Marianna, who was to be wed to her neighbour, Toni. A Turkish servant of Marianna was also enamoured by her, but she thought nothing of him. Defeated, he escaped the island and went back to Turkey, however, on the day when Marianna was to be wed to Toni, a pirate ship with none other that the Turkish servant raided the Maltese Islands, thus the Turkish servant proceeded to vengefully kidnap Marianna and take her to his shores.

Toni was brokenhearted, yet he soon thought of a plan to save his beloved. He disguised himself as a wool merchant, and travelled to Turkey, where he vowed to find Marianna and save her. One day, after months of searching with no success, he heard a traditional Maltese song being sung sweetly by a female voice. Toni followed the voice to the Sultan’s quarters, and realised that his bride was being held there. Luckily for the couple, the Sultan’s daughter befriended Marianna, and vowed to save her and return her to her beloved. Their plan was a success, and upon their return to Malta, they wed, with their families present, and presumably lived happily ever after.

While this legend of love and abduction has no actual historical basis, it is documented that during the middle of the 16th century, around 400 prisoners were abducted from Mosta and taken by Turkish corsairs. It is however documented that a woman dressed as a bride, was one of the taken. A garden, known as the “Bride of Mosta” garden, was duly named after this folktale.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZEyr1rh4aL/?taken-at=64619

Another attraction in Mosta, which is also entangled with an urban legend, is the Speranza Chapel, found in the Speranza valley. This chapel was built in the 1700s, and the urban legend concerning this building is also tied to a Turkish invasion, as abductions within the village of Mosta were a common occurrence at the time. Legend has it that during one of such invasions, a young girl and her sisters, whilst tending to their family’s sheep, were persecuted by a group of Turkish pirates. Her sisters managed to escape, yet the young girl could not run fast enough. She hid in a cave, situated underneath the Chapel, and prayed to Our Mary for salvation, and promising that if she saved her, she would build a chapel dedicated to Our Lady. When the Turkish invaders arrived at the mouth of the cave, there was no sign of the young girl. In fact, it is said that there was a spider web covering the mouth of the cave- they reasoned that if someone did enter the cave, the web would not be intact. They therefore fled the scene, and the young girl was saved.

            [blog_content] => Malta and the arts- they go hand in hand. This tiny island is packed with local talent, and attracts musical acts from around the world. The following are a few well known acts to follow this year- trust me, they will knock your socks off.
<h3>1. Rotting Christ- 23rd September, 2017</h3>
This gig will be held at the new and highly raved about “The Garage”, Zebbug. Rotting Christ is a Greek extreme death metal/grind band,  formed in 1987. The current band members are the original; Jim (bass) and the brothers Sakis (vocals, guitar) and Themis on drums. They are predominantly known for their ground-breaking album <i>Passage to Arcturo, </i>and have toured and performed in festivals all over the world, including Waken Open Air in Germany, 2003. They are currently working on another album, set to release in 2018.

<h3>2. Black Sabbath; The End of the End, 28th September 2017</h3>
If you haven’t had the privilege of watching Black Sabbath live (born in the wrong decade?), don’t miss out on the chance of watching their performance at the Eden Cinemas. It won’t be live, but it will sure feel like it. Black Sabbath were an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968- the golden age of rock- by guitarist/ songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler, drummer Bill Ward and the notorious Ozzy Osbourne. They are famous for ultra-catchy, expertly crafted hits like “Crazy Train”, “Iron Man”, and of course “Paranoid”. Rock fan or not, this will be an experience to remember, all in the comfort of a cinema.

<h3>3. The Hives, 29th September 2017</h3>
This Swedish rock band made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, through the release of their album <i>Veni Vidi Vicious, </i>home to their number 1 hit “Hate to Say I Told You So”. This was followed by albums such as <i>Tyrannosaurus Hives, The Black and White Album </i>and <i>Lex Hives. </i>They have also collaborated with music legends such as music producer Timbaland, in his hit song “Throw It on Me”. An act not to be missed!

<h3>5. Lacuna Coil, 10th November, 2017</h3>
Lacuna Coil is a gothic metal/alternative metal band from Milan, Italy- one of Italy’s most successful rock and roll exports to date. Formed in 1994, the band was formerly known as Sleep of Right and Ethereal. Its main focus is on the contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies that help create a melodic, detached sound. The band's 2012 release, <i>Dark Adrenaline</i>, peaked at number 15 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. They have toured internationally and were nominated for a MTV Music Award. This show will definitely be a nostalgic trip to the past!

<h3>6. Boyce Avenue, 11th November 2017</h3>
Held in the Mediterranean Conference Centre in Valletta, this is the one show you don’t want to miss. Boyce Avenue was formed in Florida, by brothers Alejandro Luis Manzano, Daniel Enrique Manzano, and Fabian Rafael Manzano. The band is named after a combination of two streets the brothers lived on as children. They rose to fame through videos of acoustic covers of original songs displayed on  youtube, solo or even in collaboration with other popular artists such as Megan Nicole and Hannah Trigwell. Even though they are best known for their covers, their debut album entitled <i>All We Have Left </i>contained original music, including lead singles such are “Every Breath”, “On my Way” and “Broken Angels”. Boyce Avenue has since racked up over 3.3 billion views on Youtube, and garnered over 9.8 million fans and subscribers. Ideal for hardcore fans or for those who want to try something new.

            [blog_content] => Maltese people; we like to try everything once. We’re not afraid of taking up a foodie challenge, and let’s face it, sushi is very much out of our Mediterranean comfort zone. However, once we experience something, and we truly love it, we’ll do our best to integrate it into our everyday life, and make it our own. Therefore it is of no surprise that Malta boasts of excellent sushi joints around the island, ranging between cheap eats and fine dining. This is the ultimate blogger’s list, a blogger who loves sushi very, very much.

<h3>1. Club Sushi, Paceville</h3>
This place specializes in both Japanese style and Korean style cuisine, which is amazing because they are both equally delicious and appetizing. However, their sushi is definitely a highlight. The sushi bar is placed right behind clear glass, for anyone to watch the sushi chef roll out his magnificent creations, and boy are they magnificent. These pieces of sushi are works of art, the kind that you don’t really want to eat, because they are that perfect, but it is sushi so you’re obviously going to eat it.

<h3>2. Gochi, Paceville</h3>
To go or to stay? That is the question. This tiny restaurant caters for sushi take-out or dine-in, but whichever you choose, the experience is going to be the same. The sushi is fresh, bountiful and very good value for money. The atmosphere is zen, and the people making your sushi are the nicest. The perfect “let’s pick up some sushi and stay in bed watching Rick and Morty” venue for your sushi take-out.

<h3>3. Okurama, Paceville</h3>
If you are ready to eat, and I mean really EAT, choose the buffet option at Okurama. You’re allowed two rounds of sushi, and one round of everything else...and this applies to each person choosing the buffet option. So imagine what going to Okurama with a bunch of friends would do to your waistline (so worth it though). This way, you can eat your weight in sushi, try out their other delicacies and have space in your supplementary stomach for dessert!

<h3>4. Zen Sushi, Mosta, Qormi and Luqa</h3>
Another take-out or dine in option, yet this place exceeds all expectations. It is not your typical sushi place. The quality is sublime, and you can feel it with every bite you take. It is slightly on the pricey side, but for good reason. It’s fresh, tasty and made the moment you order it. Highly recommended!

<h3>5. Zest, St. Julian's</h3>
This is the ultimate fine dining experience. The staff will treat you like royalty, their menu will astound you with all its imaginative creations, and the food...get ready for brilliant fusion cuisine. Combined with a lovely view overlooking spinola bay, this restaurant is the ultimate treat.

<h3>6. Sako Sushi, St. Julian's</h3>
Sako sushi, in combination with Wagamama, delivers the fastest and tastiest sushi that Malta has to offer. It uses a conveyor belt system, hence the “fastest” part, you can simply sit down and start picking out your plates. Perfect for the hungry sushi lover on the go! The plates are all colour-coordinated, granting the ultimate satisfaction of knowing exactly how much you are going to pay for each plate. Don’t be surprised if you go over your budget though, this sushi is truly addictive! The sushi chefs can also create sushi rolls for you on demand, don’t be shy to ask them!

<span style="font-weight:400;">Notte Bianca, or “White Night” in English and “Lejl Imdawwal” in Maltese, is one of Malta’s most prestigious outdoor events, attracting over 60,000 people per year.This is the culture festival’s 12th year in Valletta; rumour has it that this year’s festival, directed by Sean Buhagiar, is ready to exceed all expectations.

<span style="font-weight:400;">When we say that all of Valletta comes to life, we really mean ALL of Valletta- from the city gate, to Fort St Elmo, the streets and roads will be filled with music and entertainment. Even venturing to the Upper Barrakka gardens will be a treat- the view of the Three Cities at night will be nothing short of wonderful. Merchant Street, Strait Street and all the old Valletta side roads will be filled with stalls as well as open shops, for that bit of late night shopping. If you’re feeling cultural or artsy, all museums around the city will be open, including the Archaeology Museum and St. John’s Cathedral. This is a great opportunity for those who would like to get lost in, explore, or learn about Valletta in the most creative </span><span style="font-weight:400;">way possible.</span>

<h3><strong>1. Go on the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valletta Ghost Tour</a></strong></h3>
As you may or may not know, Valletta has a LOT of history. From The Great Siege of 1565, to both World Wars, it is safe to say that if ghosts were in fact real, they’d all be hanging out at Cafe’ Cordina, waiting to “BOO” you during the Valletta Ghost Tour. Apart from visiting Valletta in all its nightly glory, you’ll be able to learn all about the ghosts which inhabit the area- almost transported in time! Book through Fun Malta- follow this link right here for more information: <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour</a>

<h3><strong>2. Dress up as Fundamentally Maltese Characters</strong></h3>
What’s stopping you from dressing up as your favourite Maltese personalities? From La Vallette to your mother-in-law, the choices are truly endless. Some good couple costume ideas are the Maltese Flag, the Azure Window (R.I.P), and possibly twistees and kinnie. Extra points for dressing up as pastizzi.

<h3><strong>3. Go Trick or Treating</strong></h3>
So once you’ve decided on your costume, it’s time to show everyone what a truly Malta-loving trick or treater you are. Major areas to hit may be Sliema, St. Julians and Swieqi area, where lots of children and teens alike attempt trick or treating. Whether you trick or receive a treat, it’s great fun!

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VqrAsdR88b9VC/giphy.gif" alt="DogVacay halloween puppies funny dog cute puppy GIF" />
<h3><strong>4. Watch a scary movie</strong></h3>
What’s better than movie theatre popcorn, candy, and a screamer? Go to the Eden Cinemas on halloween night- there are many horror movies out right now, as tis’ the season to be absolutely terrified! From Stephen King’s  “IT” to the notoriously creepy “Mother” (not even Jennifer Lawrence can make this film less horrifying), the seat jumping in guaranteed.

<h3><strong>5. Make these cute Rice Krispy Treat Brains to gross out your friends and family</strong></h3>
[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="650"]<img src="https://leftbraincraftbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Rice-Krispy-Treat-Brains-Square-Left-Brain-Craft-Brain.png" alt="Image result for rice krispy treats brains" width="650" height="650" /> <i><span style="font-weight:400;">Via Left Brain Craft Brain</span></i>[/caption]

These are a no-brainer (get it?); they are so simple to make! All you will need is 6 cups of Rice Krispies Cereal, red food colouring, red gel icing some cooking spray, 3 tablespoons of butter and a bag of mini marshmallows. Melt the butter, add marshmallows and heat until melted, adding the red food colouring as you stir. Add the cereal and stir into the gooey mush, and once all cereals are evenly coated, spray hands with cooking spray and shape the cereal mush into tiny little brains. Add icing gel for decoration!

Happy halloween!

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3465" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/malta-2744589_960_720.jpg" alt="malta-2744589_960_720.jpg" width="540" height="720" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Full of history, culture and tradition, Mdina’s history dates back 4000 years, as it was occupied by the Phoenicians, the Romans and soon after, the Arabs, who gave it the arabic name of “Medina”. According to the Holy Bible, within the Acts of the Apostles, it was St. Paul’s shipwreck which introduced the people of Melite (a name adopted during Roman rule) to Catholicism. St. Paul’s Cathedral is dedicated to this momentous event, yet it was severely damaged in the 1693 Sicily earthquake. It was restructured and rebuilt in Baroque style by Lorenzo Gafa’, and is in fact regarded as Gafa’s masterpiece.  The Domvs Romana, a </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Roman-era house</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">containing several well preserved mosaics, the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">c</span><span style="font-weight:400;">atacombs, St. Paul's Grotto; these are all</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a testament to the Roman rule in Mdina. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Throughout modern history, Mdina gained its status as Citta’ Notabile (the Noble City) due to the fact that it was (and is) home to the most respectable noble and religious figures in the country, descending from Norman, Sicilian and Spanish rulers, which gave Mdina its beautifully majestic palaces and artistic monasteries and churches. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3479" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/church-1961450_1920.jpg" alt="church-1961450_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1280" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Mdina will greet you with its city gate, the main gate to the fortified city, built in Baroque style back in 1724. Beyond the gate, you will find cobbled streets leading to museums, churches, fine restaurants and cafe’s. If you’re a history aficionado, visit Palazzo Falson, a historic house museum built for Maltese nobility and the second oldest building in Mdina, containing antique domestic belongings and collections. If you have a flair horror and gore, visit the Mdina Dungeon Museum, a recollection of terrible Medieval tales of torture located in the dark secret passageways underneath Palazzo Vilhena. If you are more likely to enjoy the city when relaxed, visit Fontanella Cafe’ for some good food, exquisite cake and a marvellous view of the Maltese countryside. There are so many ways to appreciate this beautiful city.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Mdina is enjoyed at anytime of the day, but it is particularly enjoyed by night, when the streets are empty and quiet, the city is dimly lit, and exploring is encouraged. Currently, around 300 people inhabit the city, with a strict “no cars allowed” policy for pedestrians to roam around freely, conserving its royal and antique atmosphere. It is of no wonder that it is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</span>

            [blog_content] => <span lang="en-US">The humble Gin and Tonic is quite possibly one of the most refreshing alcoholic drinks you could ask for. This simple drink is generally made using one to three parts of gin (that depends on your tastes, or how hard a day of work you’ve had…) to three parts of tonic water, some ice, and a slice of lime, lemon, or cucumber to top it all off. Whether you’re a die-hard fan of the traditional recipe or are up for something a little fancier, we’ve got you covered darling.</span>

But sometimes, travelling isn’t all sunshine and mojitos - sometimes, you’ll have to deal with the odd…hiccup or two. Let’s take a look at some tried-and-tested tips to help you have the most laid-back flight possible, no matter where you’re flying to!</span>
<h3><strong>1. </strong><b>Make a list</b></h3>
<span lang="en-US">Your list is your friend. Making a list of all the things you’ll need for you holiday will help you dial down the packing panic, save time, and keep things strictly to the essentials. No, you don’t need 9 pairs of shoes. Put them down. Good job.</span>

<h3 align="LEFT"><strong>2. </strong><b>Wear something comfy</b></h3>
<span lang="en-US">Whether it’s a 3-or-12 hour flight you’ve got ahead of you, comfort is the key when you’re travelling. The last thing you need when you’re dealing with those all-important security checks and questionable leg-room is an uncomfortable outfit.</span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/c11ISnPiRdis8/giphy.gif" alt="NETFLIX meat grill steak grilling GIF" />
<h3><strong>1. <b>Brass amp; Knuckle, Naxxar</b></strong></h3>
This restaurant offers the best quality cuts money can buy, to be enjoyed as a dine-in experience, or to be taken home and cooked to your personal liking. However, the dine-in option is highly recommended (who wants to be washing dishes after a delicious steak, anyway?). You get to choose your meat, your cut, and have it cooked to your liking. Brass amp; Knuckle is also home to the best Wagyu beef in Malta- pricey, yet an otherworldly experience!

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BZqWRWTl2H7/?taken-by=brasssandknuckle/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>2. <b>Chukkas, Marsa</b></strong></h3>
Set in the Malta Polo Club, right opposite the track, this Argentinian steakhouse offers a relaxed, friendly environment in order to enjoy the juiciest of meats. Their Argentinian steaks are cooked on a log grill, which is found on the ground floor of the establishment, and boy is the pay-off astounding. The prices are more than reasonable, and the staff is super friendly. Bring all of your friends, as large groups are catered for exquisitely, and enjoy the most succulent steak on the island!

<h3><strong>3. <b>Dayfresh, Birkirkara</b></strong></h3>
This is no ordinary restaurant- this is a 2-for-1: a butcher’s and a restaurant. This restaurant also offers the commodity of dining in or taking your cut home. Once you order your drinks, the chefs will greet you and explain the variety of fresh cuts in store that day- from grassfed New Zealand to bistecca alla Fiorentina, and they will also recommend the best way to eat the cut chosen (some are best enjoyed rare!).  A casual, warm setting to enjoy your custom made steak.

<h3><strong>4. <b>BosSteaks, Marsascala</b></strong></h3>
Situated right across Marsascala bay, this one of a kind restaurant and grill has a name that explains it all- the steaks here are boss. They offer the best Scottona steaks and the most authentic Italian meat dishes, such as the 'Scaloppina di Vitello' and 'Carne alla Pizzaiola’. They also offer the meatiest, most luscious rack or ribs on the island. Let’s do the math- perfect setting+ steaks+ ribs= let’s go!

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/7v91uwGpfcun6/giphy.gif" alt=" steak GIF" />
<h3><strong>5. <b>Meet Argentinian Steakhouse, St. Julians</b></strong></h3>
This restaurant can be found on top of Ryan’s bar, overlooking Spinola Bay and all of the hustle and bustle of St. Julians. It combines the best of Argentinian cuisine, the most flavourful and deepest wines, with a South American atmosphere. The meat is cooked on a parrilla, a style of grill used for cooking “asado”, or barbecue, commonly used in Latin America. The menu offered is extensive, yet the rib-eyes steal the show every time. Missing out on this would be a missed steak.

Every Monday we will be posting a new recipe from Malta, to inspire you for the upcoming week. This week we focus on l-Għadam tal-Mejtin, a traditional Maltese sweet eaten during the first few days of November, during which we commemorate the dead on All Souls Day.

<strong>Għadam tal-mejtin</strong>
<div>

<em>Ingredients yield around 18-20 almond bones</em>

For the pastry:
800g plain flour, sifted
300g sugar
125g shortening
125g margarine
3 eggs
Juice of half a lemon
Vanilla essence
Dash of milk

For the filling paste:
400 grams sugar
400 grams pure ground almond
80ml water

You will also need some icing sugar and optional crushed almonds for decoration.

</div>
<div></div>
<div>Method:</div>
<div></div>
<div>

1. Make the pastry by rubbing in the shortening, butter and flour until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Mix the sugar with the eggs and add the mixture above.

2. Add the lemon and the vanilla essence and knead it. Add the milk and knead it to an elastic dough.

3. For the filling put the sugar and the water on a low flame and when sugar melts add the almonds. Blend the mixture very well, and let it cool.

4. Roll out the pastry and cut out your shapes. Make two of each figure as they will be sandwiched with almond paste.

5. Lay the first shape on a greased and floured baking tray, spread with almond paste, leaving a small margin. Lay the second shape over the top and press the edges together. Wet the edges with a brush dipped in milk to ensure adhesion.

6. Bake at 180'C/350'F/gas 4, for about 20 minutes, until pale golden. Cool on the tray before decorating.

7. When the bones are cold, coat with light royal icing. You can sprinkle the top with crushed almonds if you wish. Let it dry for few minutes and they are ready to enjoy!

For families who love a getaway or two, a travel destination to consider is the island of Malta.

<strong>Magnificent Malta</strong>

As a “sun and sea" destination, Malta is home to many majestic beaches, each with crystal-clear turquoise-blue waters that seemingly stretch on forever. Some of the island's best are listed in <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/05/08/6-beaches-in-malta-youll-fall-in-love-with/">our post the ‘6 Beaches in Malta You’ll Fall in Love With’</a>. Malta is also home to an array of stunning views, picturesque sceneries, and culturally significant heritage sites.

<strong>When Travelling to Malta</strong>

For families planning a getaway to Malta, it is best to plan ahead. The following tips will be useful:

1. <em>Pack for the Climate</em> – The climate in Malta, <a href="http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/malta">according to The Commonwealth</a>, is typically Mediterranean—lots of sun during the summers, mostly cool during autumn and spring, and mildly cold during winters. So, consider when the trip will be and pack accordingly.

2. <em>Plan an Itinerary</em> – Planning gives a family the opportunity to choose the best destinations, chow down the finest delicacies, and try out all the must-do activities that a place has to offer. Best of all, the family can stay within a set budget and avoid overspending.

3. <em>Try the Local Cuisine</em> – Malta offers diverse dishes, and the food that is available on this beautiful island, is a definite must-try. The cuisine is diverse and delectable, with treats available for every type of palate. Qaqocc mimli, or stuffed artichokes, is a traditional Maltese dish that is prepared in a variety of ways from household to household. Helwa tat-Tork is a sweet delight made of tahini, almonds, and vanilla, and an absolute gastronomic delight.

4. <em>Immerse Yourself in History</em> – Malta is steeped in culture and rich in tradition, and what better way to enjoy this destination than to experience first-hand its culture and traditions. One way to do this is to take part in village festas, which are long on merrymaking and steeped in tradition. Here is <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/08/18/the-maltese-village-festas-where-to-go-this-summer/">Shortletmalta's list of the best festas</a> and their dates so tourists can plan accordingly.

5. <em>Get Some Sleep</em> – Adequate sleep should always be part of any getaway because it gives the body and mind enough time to recover and recharge. Unfortunately, falling asleep in a different bed in a different room and in a different time zone can be quite difficult for some people. However, that doesn’t mean you cannot enjoy your holiday; it just means you should avoid certain things to ensure you get enough rest. <a href="http://blog.leesa.com/how-to-fall-asleep-fast-our-25-best-tips/">Leesa lists 25 tips that can help people sleep</a>, which are ideal for people on vacation. Some of the tips include cutting down on caffeine, increasing the amount of fruit and vegetables in your diet, and avoiding electronic gadgets while in bed.

<strong>Why Traveling is Important</strong>

<a href="https://stuffedsuitcase.com/5-reasons-why-travel-is-good-for-your-family/">Stuffed Suitcase encourages people to enjoy a getaway</a> once in a while because travelling is a proven stress-buster. It is also a wonderful way to create memories that last a lifetime.

Travelling can also be an eye-opener and an opportunity to learn not only about the places being visited, but also about each family member.

Equally important, travel is good for children. Travelling activates triggers that release neurochemicals—opioids, oxytocin, and dopamine, most notably—that enhance brain development.

<strong>Making Memories in Malta</strong>

A family that travels together creates memories that can last forever, and there are very few places on Earth where families can make more beautiful memories than on the island of Malta.

<h3>First things first- why recycle?</h3>
<ol>
	<li><b>Recycling conserves our natural resources</b>, meaning that products are recycled in order to make new products, without having to resort to nature, i.e extracting fresh, raw material from the Earth, saving natural habitats.</li>
	<li><b>Recycling saves energy</b>, as using recycled materials, instead of using new raw materials and starting from scratch, means using less energy (especially when considering the extracting, refining, transportation and processing of raw materials costs).</li>
	<li><b>Recycling helps protect the environment- </b>recycling means reducing the need to extract raw materials from  Earth, removing the need for mining, quarrying and logging, all of which are processes which contribute immensely to water and air pollution. This means that greenhouse gases are reduced, therefore reducing the impact on climate change, therefore saving the penguins and the polar bears. Here’s a cute polar bear GIF to encourage you to recycle-<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/aK4wh0UE3oddS/giphy.gif" alt="Polar Bear Time GIF" /></li>
	<li><b>Recycling reduces landfill, </b>as the total amount of waste sent to the landfill reduces, reducing greenhouse gases.</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight:400;">As a global community, we all need to do our bit. Whether we are at home, in our own country, or on vacation, the rules of recycling should always be followed.  Recycling in Malta will soon be made compulsory in our effort to reduce our impact on the environment, and new laws implemented at the end of the year will require people to separate recyclable, organic and waste streams. A new Littering Act is also in the process of being drafted. I could mention thousands of reasons why these are all brilliant ideas, but instead I’ll direct you to the link below, to see for yourself-</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJqLxBl9CRM
<h3><span style="font-weight:400;">So let’s get right to it- these are the Dos and Don’ts of recycling in Malta:</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DO- Get some grey or green bags for home collection arranged by your local council (you can click on this link here-</span><a href="http://www.wasteservmalta.com/homecollection-"> <span style="font-weight:400;">http://www.wasteservmalta.com/homecollection-</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> to check collection times in your area).</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DO- Deposit recyclable waste in one of the Bring In sites if you are on the move (four coloured bins adjacent to each other, one for paper, one for plastic, one for glass and another for metals)- these are available across Malta and Gozo. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DO- Include paper, cardboard, plastic, metals and juice or milk cartons in your grey recycling bag after they’ve been cleaned with some water and soap. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DON’T- Include the following items in your grey bag; glass, broken mirrors or porcelain, tissues, wet wipes, nappies, cling film, unclean foil, stickers, bottles still containing any cleaning agents or cosmetic product, non-empty spray cans, lighters, batteries and bulky metal or plastic objects. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DON’T- Throw away old clothes that you’d like to leave behind, in order to obtain more luggage space. Clothing materials do not eventually disintegrate like cotton and cause environmental damages. Look for big, blue, box-like bins around the Maltese Islands, supplied by Refab Malta, and deposit the clothes there, for them to be reused or recycled. Unless, of course, you’d like to donate them to an animal shelter, to keep their dogs warm at night. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">DON’T- Ignore these rules, or else Al Gore will be disappointed, and nobody wants a disappointed Al Gore. </span></li>
</ul>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26gsl1MREibHbIxs4/giphy.gif" alt="Leonardo Dicaprio Applause GIF by The Academy Awards" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Even better than recycling, you can follow the other two simple ‘R’ules- reduce and reuse. Reducing the amount of waste recycled can greatly impact the amount of waste to be sent to landfills or recycling centres. Reducing waste goes hand-in-hand with reusing items that you have in the house, giving them a new purpose other than the original, thus keeping them around and not throwing them away. For some inspiration, watch the youtube clip below: </span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDQcBQUDpw

<span style="font-weight:400;">Malta is all about relaxing and enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and nobody can deny the benefits of a vacation. However, you too can return the favour and do your bit when it comes to keeping our Island clean and environment friendly. Happy holidays! </span>

            [blog_content] => Soppa tal-armla is a winter staple in many a Maltese home. It is a hearty and filling dish which is also healthy, making it a perfect dinner option on cold Winter nights. 'Soppa tal-Armla' means Widow's Soup in Maltese, and it refers to the humble ingredients it is made up of; ingredients which even Maltese widows of the past could afford. Yet although the ingredients are modest, the taste is not! Here's how you can make this flavorful soup yourself:

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">As I was driving home last night, I noticed that the streets were decorated brightly, some houses already had little Santa Claus robbers climbing up their balcony, and Pama Supermarket readied their Christmas tree outside their shopping mall. Lovely. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Then, in a panic, it hit me. It’s Christmas in a month’s time. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Sure, Christmas is said to be a time for family, for festivities, for togetherness. All positive things. For others, like myself, it means one thing, and one thing only- a surplus of food, which my body can barely handle. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Okay that was a lie, my body can handle the food surplus. It can handle it so well, that last year, my love handles became just a little bit more prominent. I’m pretty sure that this year my body is more than ready to make more room for all that lovely festive food. No doubt actually. </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eSQKNSmg07dHq/giphy.gif" alt="Hungry Full House GIF" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">Yet this is a healthy eating post. My mission this month is to go on a healthy detox, anticipating the stuffing-my-face-with-all-that-is-good mission, and I’m positive that there are others, like me, who will be following suit (post-Christmas love handles is an epidemic and this is the cure). </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SasDDqOSRclNu/giphy.gif" alt="Mr Bean Eating GIF" />
<span style="font-weight:400;">The only problem is that I’m a die-hard, self-professed foodie. This island has so much to offer; culture, history, tradition, long walks along it’s many beaches. However, being Self Professed Foodie, I choose to regard the abundance of tender, heart-warming, comforting food Malta has to offer as both its best attribute, and its curse.  Therefore, it’s hard to convince oneself to eat super healthy food, be more active and follow all the fitness instagram accounts for that touch of inspiration, in a country rich with super good, mostly carb-y, majorly fatty, food. </span>

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ef61oIGVyckY8/giphy.gif" alt="Bunny Eating GIF" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">This is therefore my gift to you, fellow foodie, panicking Shortlets Malta readers. Here is a personal list of the top 7 Healthy Eats in Malta.</span>
<h3><b>1.  Eeetwell, St. Julians</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Ideal for a sit-down meal or to go, Eeetwell caters for all the health-junkies out there; from smoothies to protein shakes for that morning health-kick, to solid lunch foods like salads and ciabattas. There’s something for everyone- having eaten there a few times myself, there’s no way one can leave the premises disappointed with their order. Healthy, convenient, and delicious!</span>

<h3><b>2. Bongo Nyah</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Perfect healthy date night option, or a great consideration for when you want to go out with your fellow foodie friends, who don’t dare to sway from their foodie ideals. They have meals, platters, cocktails, different kinds of cuisines from all around the world- most importantly, it’s the place to be for a chilled night out with friends. A highly satisfying experience!</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BMH4JAjjAbc/?taken-by=bongo.nyah/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><b>3. Yue Bistro by Munchies, Naxxar</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This place is located within the limits of Naxxar, making it extremely central and easy to reach. Their menu boasts a healthy etiquette when preparing food, and they even have healthy burgers (salvation!). Their range of vegan desserts are to die for (don’t knock them till you try them), and what’s more, they are located right next to the YUE gym. What’s stopping you from a gym session and a healthy bite right after? Nothing, absolutely nothing.</span>

<h3><b>4. The Grassy Hopper, Valletta and Gzira</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Found in the capital city of Malta and the locality of Gzira, this restaurant specialises in vegan and vegetarian cuisine. This place started off as a kiosk, moving on to open two localities of the same name. They are experts in carefully choosing the best quality foods, to give you high quality carbs and low GMI foods, without refined sugars and starches. The same take out or dine in option also applies, making it the perfect location for a healthy snack on the way to one of Valletta’s many sites (visit <a href="http://www.funmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Fun Malta website</a> for more encouragement, or<a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/10/20/6-things-you-didnt-know-about-valletta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> follow this link</a>!</span>

<h3><b>5. Pash- The Healthy Option, St. Paul’s Bay</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This healthy eats option stems from the most humble background- the owner of Pash was a farmer, who steadily became a large importer of fruit and vegetables in Malta. His healthy lifestyle ethic transferred onto his business venture- that of establishing a vegan and vegetarian restaurant/cafe’ in a country where vegetarian options were, and still are, scarce. Pash serves serve healthy food, be it vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, organic but most importantly, they serve healthy food at its finest quality and state.</span>

            [blog_content] => Imqaret are Maltese traditional, diamond shaped sweet pastries, filled with dates and sprinkled with icing sugar.

These sweets can be enjoyed in any season, but they sure do go down well during the cold winter months! Read on to find out how to prepare these yummy pastries.

            [blog_content] => Christmas is getting nearer! This week we bring you the Maltese-style Christmas Log, which varies from the traditional Yule Log done elsewhere in the world. Our Log is less of a roll and more of a delicious mix of nuts, biscuits and glaced fruits, resulting in one of the most delectable desserts of the holidays. Want to learn how the Maltese prepare their Log? Read on, and prepare this Maltese delicacy yourself!

            [blog_content] => Christmas is just one week away, and so this week we present to you the epitome of Christmas sweets: the Christmas Cake. Malta's Christmas Cake is pretty much the same as the English Christmas Cake, having been introduced to the island during the 200 years of British Rule. Yet this dessert has formed a special place in the Maltese repertoire, and can still be found almost everywhere during these festive times.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3821" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/christmas-cake-1.jpg" alt="christmas cake 1.jpg" width="885" height="498" />
<h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>
<ul>
	<li>450g currants</li>
	<li>175g sultanas</li>
	<li>175g raisins</li>
	<li>50g chopped glacé cherries</li>
	<li>50g mixed chopped candid peel</li>
	<li>100ml brandy</li>
	<li><em>All of the above premixed and pre-soaked</em></li>
	<li>225g plain flour</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg freshly grated</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground mixed spice</li>
	<li>225g soft dark brown sugar</li>
	<li>50g chopped almonds</li>
	<li>1 dessertspoon black treacle</li>
</ul>
<em>You will also need</em>
<ul>
	<li>225g very soft butter</li>
	<li>5 medium eggs</li>
	<li>Grated zest of lemon</li>
	<li>Grated zest of orange</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>100g whole blanched almonds (only if you don't intend to ice the cake)</li>
	<li>1 heaped tbsp apricot jam</li>
	<li>1 tbsp Armagnac or brandy</li>
	<li>250g marzipan</li>
	<li>500g ready to roll icing</li>
	<li>A little icing sugar</li>
	<li>Silver balls to decorate</li>
	<li>A cake board</li>
	<li>A set of 3 star cookie cutters</li>
	<li>Red ribbon</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Method:</b></h3>
<ol>
	<li>You will need a 20 cm round cake tin, greased and lined with a double thickness of baking parchment, or bake o glide and a spot of oil. Tie a band of brown paper or (a double thickness of news paper will do) round the outside of the tin with string for extra protection. Preheat oven to 140*C/Gas Mark 1</li>
	<li>Now all you do is sift the flour, salt and spices into a very large mixing bowl, then add the sugar and butter and either whisk or beat with a wooden spoon until everything is light, pale and fluffy.</li>
	<li>Now gradually fold in the pre-soaked fruit mixture, chopped nuts and treacle and finally the grated lemon and orange zest.</li>
	<li>Next using a large kitchen spoon, transfer the cake mixture into prepared tin, spread it out evenly with the back of the spoon and, if you don't intend to decorate the cake with marzipan and icing, lightly drop the blanched almonds in circles over the surface.</li>
	<li>Finally cover the top of the cake with double layer of baking parchment with a 50c - size hole in the centre (this gives extra protection during the ling slow cooking).</li>
	<li>Bake the cake on the lowest shelf of the oven for 4 hours until it feels springy in the centre when lightly touched.</li>
	<li>Sometimes it can take 30 to 40 mins longer than this, but in any case don't check for 4 hours.</li>
	<li>Cool the cake for 30 mins in the tin, then remove it to the wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
	<li>When it's cold, feed it by making small holes in the top and bottom with a cocktail stick and spooning in a couple of tablespoons of armagnac or brandy then wrap it in double baking parchment secured with an elastic band and either wrap again in foil or store in an airtight tin.</li>
	<li>You can now feed it at odd intervals until you need to eat it.</li>
	<li>Place the cake on the cake board, then melt the jam with the armagnac or brandy in a small saucepan, stirring until all the lumps have dissolved.</li>
	<li>Now using a brush, coat the surface of the cake quiet generously with the melted mixture.</li>
	<li>Take the marzipan and roll it out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar and cut it to 20cm round and place this over the top of the cake.</li>
	<li>Repeat this step with the icing, and place it over the marzipan.</li>
	<li>Using the cutters, cut out one star of each size from the remaining rolled put icing, dampen one side of the largest star with cold water and then place this side in the centre of the cake. Then repeat with the medium and small stars.</li>
	<li>Decorate the edges of the cake and the stars with silver balls using a little water mixed with a little icing sugar as a glue to keep the silver balls in place.</li>
	<li>Keep the cake in a tin and tie a ribbon around it on Christmas day.</li>
</ol>

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">No matter what time of year you choose to visit Malta, any trip to this Mediterranean hotspot is incomplete without spending at least one day exploring our sister island. Gozo (Maltese: </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Għawdex) </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">is just a 30-minute ferry ride away from the northernmost part of the island, with return tickets costing €4.65 for adults, €1.15 for children (kids under 3 travel for free) and €15.70 for a car plus its driver (for more information, check out the Gozo Channel website). Now that we’ve got the basics covered, let’s take a look at some things you absolutely must see and do if you’re spending one day in Gozo!</span>
<h3><b>1. Take in the scenery at Dwejra</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">We may have lost the legendary Azure Window, but Dwejra offers some truly breath-taking views nonetheless. This one’s located at the other end of the island, roughly an hour away by bus and 30 minutes away if you’re driving - but trust us when we say that it’s worth it. Besides, every stop on this little one-day tour will take you closer back to the harbour for your return to Malta!</span>

<h3><b>2. See the shrine at Ta’ Pinu</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This minor Basilica is located Għarb, around 23 minutes away from Mgarr by car and approximately 45 minutes by bus. Ta’ Pinu is arguably the most famous church in Gozo, and was built in the neo-Romanesque style between 1920 and 1931 on the site of what used to be a 16th century chapel. The structure itself is stunning both inside and out, but the shrine is something else entirely. Every year, thousands of people visit the shrine to offer thanks, pray for good health or a speedy recovery, or simply to stand in awe at the collection of curious artefacts people have left there in thanks following their own miracles - no matter how big or small.</span>

<h3><b>3. Have a bite to eat in Xlendi</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Xlendi is one of our favourite places to hit when we want to feast on some fresh fish or simply have a drink while enjoying the gorgeous sea views this place has to offer. After seeing the sights at Dwejra and Ta’ Pinu, it’s time for a well-deserved pit stop so that you can rest and refuel for the next part of your day! If you’re here during the warmer months, we recommend treating yourself to some ice cream and taking a relaxing walk along the little promenade before heading to your next spot.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbM04oXhLdJ/?taken-at=223865984/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><b>4. Step back in time at Ggantija Temples</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Located in Xagħra, these megalithic temples are some of the most significant archeological sites on the Maltese Islands, and have even obtained UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Dating back to around 3600 - 3200 BC, these temples get their name from the Maltese word ‘ġgant’, meaning ‘giant’ - when you see the size of each individual stone slab, you’ll see why it’s been given that name!</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbFWmxxlQz8/?taken-at=263309935/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><b>5. See the Cittadella and round off the day with dinner </b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">After you’ve seen the temples, you might just have a bit of time to do some shopping in Victoria, but we recommend spending some time seeing the majestic Cittadella! You can’t miss it - this walled city is located on a hill overlooking the city, and looks glorious when it’s all lit up at night.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba4Yr4wD4ea/?tagged=cittadellagozo/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<span style="font-weight:400;">You’ll soon start to feel peckish, though! If you’re in the mood for some cheap, authentic Gozitan-style pizza, then grab a take-away box of deliciousness from Maxokk Bakery in Nadur - it’s a local favourite!

            [blog_content] => Maltese is a pretty tough language to learn, we’ll grant you that. There are tons of grammar rules to remember, the pronunciation can be somewhat hard to muster, and don’t get us started about the silent letters! Last year, we had already shown you <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2016/11/18/seven-essential-maltese-phrases-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seven Essential Maltese Phrases</a> which could help you find your way around Malta, and we felt it was time for a little refresh.  So here are six Maltese phrases which will help you communicate with the locals, whether you’re buying bread from the nearby bakery, or out partying in Paceville!
<h3><img style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlyypRzngfgVJqE/giphy.gifOne of the phrases you will be using the most – whether out buying coffee or drinks, or souveniers for that matter. When something is priceless, you can now ask for how much it costs, in Maltese! Tista tghini? (tiss-ta tainy?) Can you help me?https://media.giphy.com/media/Fex8y28xO00Fi/giphy.gifThe cry of lost travellers around the globe – asking for help, and knowing how to ask for help, can be a lifesaver. From figuring out bus times, to asking directions to that great restaurant you heard about, you’ll surely be needing some help at some point. Mhux nifhem. (moosh nif-emm) I don’t understand.https://media.giphy.com/media/oiJ0Yf3sLucp2/giphy.gifWhen friendly Maltese people randomly come up to you and start blabbering in Maltese, this is the phrase to use. It is much more productive to show that you are not in fact, conversant in Maltese; maybe the conversation will resume in a language you both can speak. Minn fejn int? (minn feign int?) Where are you from?https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMU17eDlWSrUXVm/giphy.gifYou will probably hear this phrase constantly, especially if you’ve got an accent. This phrase will also come in handy when making new friends, especially if you’re in a multi-cultural environment. Your new friends will love learning this small slice of Maltese! Kif tghidha bil-Malti? (keef tay-dah bill ma-lty?) How do you say that in Maltese?https://media.giphy.com/media/9YhtGOcJcwq64/giphy.gifYour Maltese mates will love this! Most Maltese love teaching their foreign friends new words and phrases in Maltese, and saying this is basically a free pass for learning ALL the Maltese words! You can think of random phrases and back those up with ‘Kif tghidha bil-Malti?’ and you’ll get yourself a Maltese lesson in no time. You’re welcome. Il-Milied it-Tajjeb!

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlyypRzngfgVJqE/giphy.gif" />

One of the phrases you will be using the most – whether out buying coffee or drinks, or souvenirs for that matter. When something is price-less, you can now ask for how much it costs, in Maltese!
<h3><strong>2. Tista tghini? (tiss-ta teyny?) Can you help me?</strong></h3>
<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Fex8y28xO00Fi/giphy.gif" />

The cry of lost travelers around the globe – knowing <em>how</em> to ask for help in the local lingo can be a lifesaver. From figuring out bus times, to asking directions to that great restaurant you heard about, you’ll surely be needing some help at some point.
<h3><strong>3. Mhux nifhem. (moosh nif-emm) I don’t understand.</strong></h3>
<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/oiJ0Yf3sLucp2/giphy.gif" />

When friendly Maltese people randomly come up to you and start chatting in Maltese, this is the phrase to use. It is much more productive to show that you are not in fact, conversant in Maltese; maybe the conversation will resume in a language you both can speak.
<h3><strong>4. Minn fejn int? (minn feyn int?) Where are you from?</strong></h3>

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/9YhtGOcJcwq64/giphy.gif" />

Your Maltese mates will love this! Most Maltese love teaching their foreign friends new words and phrases in their native tongue, and asking this is basically a free pass for learning ALL the Maltese words! You can think of random phrases and end your sentence with ‘Kif tghidha bil-Malti?’ and you’ll get yourself a Maltese lesson in no time. You’re welcome.
<h3><strong>6. Il-Milied it-Tajjeb! (il mil-eed it tahy-yeb) Happy Christmas!</strong></h3>
<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Wo72ksPDndqvK/giphy.gif" />

The season to be jolly is soon upon us, so you’ll be hearing this non-stop for the next month or so. Also, it is thoughtful to wish your Maltese friends a merry Christmas in their own language. You can say you memorised it as a thoughtful Christmas Gift!

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If you’re visiting Malta for the first time, you’ll probably already know about our stunning capital, Valletta, and the ever-enchanting ‘Silent City’ Mdina; but don’t forget about Vittoriosa, Senglea, and Cospicua - also known as The Three Cities! If you look out over the Grand Harbour from Valletta’s Upper Barrakka Gardens, you’ll see the imposing bastions that have protected these historic cities for centuries. You can easily get to any one of the three by bus, and it’s well worth spending a full day taking in all the authentic Maltese sights that each city has to offer. Before you plan your trip to the Three Cities, let’s take a look at a few things you might not know about them! </span>
<h3><strong>1. <b>They’ve got two names</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">That’s right! Vittoriosa is also known as Birgu, while Senglea and Cospicua also go by the names of Isla and Bormla respectively. Confused? Don’t worry. You’ll get it in time. </span>

<h3><strong>2. <b>You can get there by boat</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you don’t feel like taking the bus or driving to the Three Cities, then why not take the ferry from Valletta, right across the harbour? You’ll get to see some unbeatable views of the bastions and you’ll save time to boot!</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbg26qXgY6P/?tagged=thethreecities/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>3. <b>Vittoriosa was our first capital city</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">And Mdina was our second! The Knights of St. John made Birgu their seat of power, later renaming the city ‘Cittá Vittoriosa’ (roughly translated to ‘the victorious city’) in celebration of the Maltese triumph over the Turkish armada in the Great Siege of 1565. </span>

<h3 id=":13r" class="ajR" role="button"><img class="ajT" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" /><strong>4. <b>The Inquisition dropped by for a bit…</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">When the Inquisition blazed through Europe and South America in the 16th and 17th centuries, they didn’t miss this little island in the middle of the Mediterranean. While very few structures from that period remain, Birgu is home to the Inquisitor’s Palace, which was built in the 1530s to serve as law courts (and a prison) for anyone accused of committed acts of heresy in Malta. Today, visitors can learn more about our island’s religious traditions, with historic reconstructions and exhibitions on display all over the beautiful palace. </span>

<h3><strong>5. </strong><b>Birgufest is totally a thing</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">And you should attend if you have the chance! Birgufest is an annual event that celebrates the city’s rich, proud history. Streets are lit up by soft candlelight, looking almost other-worldly, and there are loads of activities, re-enactments, and museums (with discounted entry) to enjoy with friends and family. It’s a magical night out and definitely one you’ll remember!</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BaeOOb6B0Wu/?tagged=birgufest/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>6. <b>The cities were hit hard during WWII</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">During what later became known as ‘the Siege of Malta’, the strategically well-positioned Three Cities were very heavily bombed, with almost every building either sustaining damage or being razed to the ground. Never to be defeated, the Three Cities rose again after being rebuilt in the 1950s and 60s.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbaHtFeFssT/?taken-at=259596426/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>7. <b>Senglea keeps an eye on the harbour</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">We mean that quite literally! Head to Gardjola Gardens in Senglea and you’ll be treated to sweeping views of the Grand Harbour, best enjoyed from a beautiful watchtower perched on the side of the bastions. The watchtower has eyes carved into it, in a typically-Maltese style, which are said to keep misfortune or evil spirits at bay. </span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BS61zE5ABGC/?tagged=gardjola/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>8. </strong><b>They’re home to some of the friendliest locals you’ll ever meet</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">A visit to any one of the Three Cities will have you meeting some of the nicest, most welcoming people on the island. You’ll get a real taste of Maltese hospitality here - ask for directions, and the chances are your ‘guide’ will walk you there themselves and give you a quick tour of the place while they’re at it! (We’re only half joking about that one)</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQHwqDwgDaw/?tagged=thethreecities/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>9. You can book a night tour of Vittoriosa…with dinner</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you want to explore Birgu at night, then our <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vittoriosa night tours</a> are the answer! Join us for a one-and-a-half hour trip through the city’s enchanting history, with an optional dinner waiting for you at the end.

            [blog_content] => One of the best things about Christmas (after being able to stuff yourself silly with festive food and naughty holiday treats) has to be seeing the look on a loved one’s face when you <em>know </em>you just nailed the perfect Christmas gift. It’s not how much you spend on a present, of course. It’s all about the thought you put into coming up with something you know they’ll love, and taking the time to wrap it up nicely until Christmas day rolls around. It’s not always as easy as we’d like things to be when you’re trying to think about what to get your nearest and dearest, but have no fear: we’re here to help. Let’s take a look at a few Christmas gift ideas for you to consider this festive season!
<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong>Present-Filled <em>Papoċċ </em>(Present-filled slippers)</strong></h3>
Think of this as a cute Christmas stocking with a bit of a twist. With the cold winter weather tapping at our doors, it’s safe to assume that everyone appreciates a little something snuggly to keep their toes warm. For this quirky gift idea, you’ll need to buy a (preferrably fluffy) pair of slippers and fill them with thoughtful bits and pieces that you know they’ll love. Not sure where to start? Here’s some inspiration:
<ul>
	<li>Their favourite chocolates or sweets</li>
	<li>Make up</li>
	<li>Accessories</li>
	<li>Face masks</li>
	<li>Stationery</li>
	<li>Earbud headphones</li>
	<li>Lip balm</li>
	<li>Luxurious body butter</li>
	<li>Jewellery</li>
	<li>Gift vouchers</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2. An Adult-Life Survival Kit</strong></h3>
Perfect as a Secret Santa fit, or when your bestie just need a pick-me-up after a tough time, the Adult-Life Survival Kit adds a hint of humour into the mix. For this thoughtful gift, you’ll need to choose a few different items that (in your opinion) will help the recipient through the trials and tribulations of what many call ‘adulting’. Now the contents of your survival kit should vary from person to person - the only things that remain constant are the nice-looking box you’ll package them all up in. Here are a few quick suggestions to get the ideas going:
<ul>
	<li>Mini-prosecco/wine</li>
	<li>Luxury hot chocolate (i.e. the kind you melt into hot milk)</li>
	<li>Painkillers (for hangovers)</li>
	<li>2018 diary or planner</li>
	<li>Scented candle/incense</li>
	<li>Delicious chocolates</li>
	<li>Tea/Herbal tea</li>
	<li>Fluffy socks</li>
	<li>Inexpensive wristwatch</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>3. Pottery Classes</strong></h3>
<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/pottery-classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pottery classes</a> in Malta  have become pretty popular in recent years! A fun, hands-on activity for children and adults alike, pottery classes are a great way to introduce that creative person in your life to what could be a brand-new hobby. Making a piece of pottery is satisfying, and even if it doesn’t turn out 100% perfect the first time around, they’ll still go home with a unique memento!

<h3><strong>4. Pop Vinyl Figurines </strong></h3>
You don’t need to be a fully-fledged, die-hard  pop culture aficionado to appreciate this adorable little Pop Vinyls! Whether they’re into superheroes, sci-fi, Disney, video games or cult classics, you’ll definitely find something to suit their tastes.

<h3><strong>6. A Recipe Book</strong></h3>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:150%;">And we don’t mean a ready-made book of recipes by Nigella or Jamie Oliver.

            [blog_content] => Unless you’re one of those people who totally relate to the Grinch, at least a teeny, tiny part of you will always look forward to Christmas time. From decorating the tree, to trying to convince your partner that you really don’t need so many lights hanging across the façade of the house, and let’s not forget Costa Coffee’s highly decadent, albeit expensive, seasonal hot chocolates- it’s a time for cheer, memories and a sense of nostalgia.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5KuPVqoVRvQcg/giphy.gif" alt="Santa Claus Christmas GIF" />

For some Maltese people, our twelve days of Christmas consist in reminiscing Christmas days passed, with “Nanna” and “Nannu” (Maltese grandparents- an entirely unique breed of grandparents) and all the fun activities we used to engage in. Fond are the memories of waiting for the “ġulbiena” (vetch) to grow, making a “presepju” (nativity crib) with Nannu, and falling asleep during the midnight mass service (to be fair, it was a rather long service). The memories are endless. This year, instead of fondly sharing the memories over a glass of wine too many, why not relive them with your friends and family?

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MrxXXBriEIKBO/giphy.gif" alt="Will Ferrell Christmas GIF" />

Here are some of the old Maltese Christmas Traditions to share with your loved ones this year:

<strong>1. Build a Crib: </strong>this is a fun activity for both children and adults. Whether you are a perfectionist or you just like to improvise and see where you eventually get to, this craft will engage you and bring out your inner artiste. Recycle materials found in your home- from packing materials like jablo or bubble wrap, to newspapers or tiny stones and twigs from your garden, there’s nothing that can’t find a home in your nativity crib. All you need is some imagination and lots and lots of glue. Do yourself a favour though- buy the “pasturi” (nativity scene figures) from a local stationary or specialised shops. You don’t want to attempt shaping a donkey out of paper mache- the results may be horrendous.

<strong>2. Grow your own “Ġulbiena”: </strong>It is traditional, and highly fascinating and educational for the kids, to sow vetch (known to the Maltese as “ġulbiena”) on cotton around five weeks before Christmas day. It is important that the ġulbiena is left in dark areas of the house, until the seeds sprout into long, white, grass-like shoots. The ġulbiena is then used to decorate the nativity crib, so consider this a part two to the previous activity.

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/_e_I34qpUS/?tagged=gulbiena/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<strong>3. </strong><strong>Take your family to the Priedka tat-Tifel, or the Priedka Tal-Milied: </strong>This roughly translates to the preaching, or the sermon, of the child. Within the village, a boy or girl, roughly between the ages of seven and ten, is chosen to deliver a sermon during the midnight mass instead of the priest himself, giving a real sense of what Christmas is all about- the kids, of course. The child is to learn the sermon by heart, and has around four to five weeks to practice it (poor kid- these are not short sermons!). The sermon is usually a touching narration of the nativity story- about Jesus, Mary and Joseph and their many trials in Bethlehem. An endearing and utterly adorable activity.

<strong>4. The village Pageant: </strong>My nanna still owns VHS tapes of my father and aunts taking part in the so-called pageant <em>all </em>those years ago (he denies their existence). All the youths of the village deliver an Oscar worthy re-enactment of the nativity story, complete with baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the donkey (played by an unfortunate human being). This performance is given right before the village midnight mass.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/AbDCwAI2xTwTm/giphy.gif" alt="Leonardo Dicaprio Oscar GIF" />

<strong>5.  </strong><strong>Christmas lunch with the family:</strong> A tradition which is surely kept alive by many other nations. However, the difference is that other nations are not home to the Maltese Nanna, who over-cooks, over-stuffs, and if you didn’t have three helpings of food, you’re obviously sick and she’ll be worrying about you and praying for you for the rest of the year. Take on the role of Nanna this year; serve your “dundjan” (turkey), potatoes and veggies, but only <em>after </em>a helping of lasagne or soup. Finish off with three courses of dessert- Christmas pudding, followed by pastries, and obviously don’t forget the tea o’clock mince pies!

If this blog didn’t make you nostalgic and long for the upcoming month, the Grinch would be totally proud of you. Happy holidays!

            [blog_content] => Malta is a slice of Mediterranean paradise known the world over for its sun-soaked beaches and crystal-blue seas. When it comes to summertime fun, finding something to do is as easy as throwing your sunglasses on. Since our little rock is synonymous with sun, sea, and hot days spent tanning by the pool with a cocktail in hand, it can feel like a bit of a struggle to find things to do in winter if you’re not used to the colder months in Malta. Don’t you worry - winter in Malta is just as awesome as our summers, you just need to know where to go! Here are a few ideas to get you started:
<h3><strong>1. Escape Rooms</strong></h3>
Nothing tests the bonds of friendship, love, and family quite like an <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escape Room  challenge</a>. Put your powers of logic and deduction to the test and Sherlock Holmes your way out of some mind bending puzzles, or just enjoy the inevitable laughs that come with the experience if you and your loved ones fail to get out in time. Either way, it’s a fun, satisfying, and will probably leave you feeling quite pleased with yourself.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYGtCMbPTYWOzaU/giphy.gif" />
<h3><strong>2. Cafes and a Cathedral</strong></h3>
Valletta is stunning at any time of the year, so if it’s rainy just hit the capital! The city is bursting with beautiful historic sites for you to explore - indoors. Visit St. John’s Co-Cathedral and marvel at one of Caravaggio’s iconic paintings, then spend some time discovering more about Malta’s history at the National Museum of Archaeology before taking a well-deserved break at one of the many cafes dotted around the city. Kingsway is a local hotspot, and is located just a few steps away from the National Library, which is always worth a visit.

<h3><strong>3. Wine and Dine in Birgu</strong></h3>
Birgu is the perfect place to spend a rainy day in Malta! Start with a visit to the maritime museum to learn all about our island’s naval history before making your way to a cool eatery like Del Borgo, a wine bar and bistro nestled in one of the city’s narrow streets. Go on - treat yourself to some divine food and drink that’ll warm your soul right up.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdXH5fhjASGgI5W/giphy.gif" />
<h3><strong>4. Have yourself a Happy Hour </strong></h3>
Add some colour (and a few giggles) to even the rainiest of days with a cheeky little happy hour (or three) at any one of Malta’s many bars and lounges. If you’d like to sip cocktails in Sliema, one of Malta’s shopping hotspots, then try Tex Mex, Medasia, or The Black Sheep; Valletta is also home to a few local favourites, including StrEat in the heart of the city and Crave and Hard Rock down by the colourful waterfront!

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2g079qLBiShpu/giphy.gif" />
<h3><strong>5. Visit the Silent City</strong></h3>
When in doubt, spend a few hours in our enchanting ex-capital, Mdina. The Silent City is home to the beautiful St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Norman House if you’re in the mood for a bit of sightseeing and history. However you choose to spend your time in this cultural gem of a walled city, there’s one thing you can’t miss: cake and a hot drink at Fontanella! This quaint cafe is loved by locals and visitors alike, and comes complete with sweeping views of the surrounding towns and greenery.

            [blog_content] => Winter is upon us, ladies and gentlemen! The colder weather may be nipping at your cheeks and rain might be tapping gentle at your windows on some days, but as far as winters go, Malta is blessed with generally warmer weather and more sunny days than most of our European counterparts. While other countries transform swiftly into their own Winter Wonderlands and have everyone snuggled up indoors, here in Malta it’s as good a time as any to put on your walking shoes and explore! Not sure where to start? Don’t worry about that because as usual, we’ve got you covered.
<h3><strong>1. Buskett Gardens</strong></h3>
Perfect for a family day out (and a picnic if the weather permits!), Buskett springs to life after the very first post-Summer shower, with greenery bursting forth and tiny streams babbling along the forest floor after heavier rain. Anyone who’s visited these 16th century gardens will tell you that the old stone structures overgrown with dark, green foliage give Buskett an almost-enchanted feel. Oh, and while you’re there, keep an eye out for the adorable Painted Frogs and other fauna that call this place home!

<h3><strong>2. Dingli Cliffs</strong></h3>
You can actually combine this walk with the Buskett option above, because the two places are located very close to each other. If it’s a fiery sunset and a look at real, rugged Maltese countryside you want, then this is the one for you. You can even sit down on some of the perfectly-placed benches to take in some truly stunning panoramic views, and have a little breather before making your way back home.

<h3><strong>3. Valletta</strong></h3>
This one’s an say walk, perfect for a lazier day or lunchtime stroll! Our majestic capital city is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and home to a wealth of impressive monuments for you to discover and snap photos of. If it’s not windy, you can even explore the city’s rocky perimeter and see the breakwater up close. Don’t miss the chance to enjoy sweeping views of the Grand Harbour from the Upper or Lower Barrakka Gardens!

<h3><strong>4. Victoria Lines </strong></h3>
This walk is for anyone up for a bit of a challenge and lasts about 8 hours, with some gorgeous countryside views that are pretty tough to beat. The Victoria Lines are actually a historic landmark - a 12 km long fortification spanning the width of the island. The walk starts from Medliena heights and moved westwards to Kuncizjoni (close to Fomm ir-Rih) or vice versa.

<h3><strong>5. Marsaskala to Marsaxlokk</strong></h3>
This southern walk is a bit of a challenge, but super rewarding, we promise! Starting from Marsaskala, you’ll be able to enjoy breath-taking scenery and unique views of the two harbours located on the eastern side of the island. The fishing village of Marsaxlokk is the ideal place to end a long day’s trek, with typical southern charm and loads of fantastic restaurants to try.

            [blog_content] => We all that at least one friend who seems to be constantly on the lookout for their next adventure, big or small. They’re looking forward to that next rush of adrenaline that sets the heart thumping against ribs and uncontrollable smiles spreading from ear to ear. So what kind of gift should you get for someone whose sense of adventure rivals that of Indiana Jones? If you’re feeling a tad uninspired, here are a few ideas to help get the creativity flowing.
<h3><strong>1. An adventure journal</strong></h3>
Give your loved one a way to record all the precious moments, memories, and experiences they collect when they’re out on their adventures! You could, of course, go for a simple-yet-pretty version, but you could also opt for a proper Adventure Journal.

<h3><strong>2. A snazzy backpack</strong></h3>
Whether it’s camping or full-on backpacking you friend’s into, they’ll definitely appreciate a good-quality backpack to carry all the bits and pieces they’ll need to make the most of every new experience.

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcltAOUls-h/?tagged=backpack/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>3. An Action Camera</strong></h3>
If you want to get fancy on the gift-giving front, then why not go for an action camera that’ll allow any intrepid explorer to capture precious moments on video in ways that a normal camera just can’t. The GoPro is a favourite among the travelers and thrill seekers of the world!

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcin9vrlen4/?taken-by=gopro/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>4. A rock climbing session</strong></h3>
<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/rock-climbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rock climbing in Malta</a>  is the perfect way to get up close and personal with our beautiful little island! It’s a balanced blend of fun and physical and mental challenge, and it’s always an incredibly rewarding experience.

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BapArf8nvJ3/?taken-by=rockclimbing.addict/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>5. Scratch the world map </strong></h3>
For the travelers and wanderers out there, this is a great way to show off and keep track of all the fabulous places they’ve visited when they’re back home. You never know - the map might serve as a challenge, and your friend might end up scratching off every part of it!

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BMeDIDEjUVD/?tagged=scratchtheworldmap/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>6. An abseiling experience</strong></h3>
Rock climbing not quite right for your thrill-seeking companion? Don’t you worry - <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/abseiling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abseiling</a> certainly sets the pulse racing just as well! There’s nothing quite like the feeling you get when you (safely) lean back and start to rappel down Malta’s rugged-but-beautiful cliff sides.

            [blog_content] => Malta is a cultural and historical haven; it is often said that an entire lifetime is not enough to fully absorb all the history that Malta has to offer its visitors. Every village, every corner, every inch of this island, has historical significance. From the ancient Mdina, to the provincial Bormla, all the way back to the historically glorified Valletta; there’s always something to see, something to know, something to learn from.

Yet, how does one discover all of Malta’s mysteries, how does one learn of all of Malta’s stories, without making the task feel tedious? The answer is rather simple. One must live an experience to truly understand it. Not everyone enjoys excursions, tours, audio guides and pamphlets. Here are the top 5 medieval activities- your indispensable guide to learn what it truly felt to be a knight in Medieval Malta, the fun and interactive way.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/S2x6wCl6t6EWQ/giphy.gif" alt="James Horner Help GIF" />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Book a session with Malta Archery</strong>: a growing sport, or hobby, in Malta, archery is a truly fantastic way to fully immerse yourself in the Medieval period. The bow and arrow have been used for centuries in hunting and combat- but no worries, this practice is totally safe. Malta Archery caters for both adults and children, providing group or individual sessions, with an instructor who is willing to guide you throughout. So go ahead, bring out the warrior inside of you!</li>
</ul>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/3rfAh7DcYd/?tagged=maltaarchery/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ul>
	<li><strong>Visit The Trees Medieval and XXL Restaurant: </strong>feast like a King with all your royal subjects at The Trees, found in Gzira. The restaurant has a medieval theme- the staff is decked out in medieval clothes and the atmosphere is dark and dimly lit, just like a tavern. This restaurant is especially famous for its German beer, its humongous steaks and its surf amp; turf options. Go with an empty stomach, their portion sizes are, as stated, XXL- large enough to feed an entire kingdom!</li>
</ul>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/q7kofYLObTVUk/giphy.gif" alt="Lord Of The Rings Hobbit GIF" />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Take the Game of Thrones Tour: </strong>offered by Fun Malta. What’s more Medieval than King’s Landing, Dothraki and a Khaleesi? This tour is not like any other boring tour- the guides are not just any tour guides, but two local actors who have taken part in Game of thrones during its season one filming here in Malta. Although we lost the Azure Window earlier this year, we still have plenty of exclusive locations used for the production, like the Garden of King’s Landing and the Tower of the Hand. A truly enjoyable experience for all the Game of Thrones fans out there. Book your tour today by clicking <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/game-of-thrones-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11clOWGCHzWG7C/giphy.gif" alt="Game Of Thrones Dancing GIF" />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Go horse riding in Bidnija: </strong>take in the beautiful, unencumbered countryside of Bidnija, limits of Mgarr and Mosta, on the most basic, primitive yet well respected method of transportation known to man: a majestic horse. Bidnija Horse Riding offers rides around the countryside, from village to village. A qualified instructor is assigned, and no experience is truly needed. A perfect occasion to feel at one with nature.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Explore Mdina by night: </strong>join the FunMalta crew once again on an adventure in Mdina, with a dark twist. Mdina is beautiful by day, but spectacularly eerie by night. Stepping through the Mdina gate feels like stepping into a time machine- this Silent City has remained truly medieval. The site of many battles, deaths, and above all Fontanella chocolate cake (hey, medieval knights fancy cake too, y’know)- it is the one medieval experience that you don’t want to miss. Book through <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/night-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fun Malta</a>.</li>

<h3><b>1. The Cosmopolitan</b></h3>
 
The drink of choice for the fashion-savvy Carrie Bradshaw (Sex and the City, for the uninitiated), the Cosmo is a delightful mingling of sweet and sour flavours with a lovely, cheerful pink colour. It’s gluten free, and vegetarian and vegan-friendly too. Everybody’s happy, yay!

Alternately, place a lime wedge on the rim of the glass.  </span></li>

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">If Christmas day is meant for comfy pants and stuffing yourself silly with all the festive deliciousness you can stand, then New Year’s Eve should be synonymous with the clinking of champagne glasses, the people who’ve made your year special, and a sense of excitement at all the promise of a fresh year full of potential. If you’re not settled on your NYE plans yet, here are a few ideas to consider!</span>
<h3><strong>1. <b>Pyjama Party</b></strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Sometimes, the best nights out are the ones spent all cosy at home with onesies, fluffy slippers, and yummy food and drinks to warm the soul. Invite your nearest and dearest, sort out a Spotify playlist, and ring in the New Year in comfort. Can’t host your event at home? Don’t worry - there are loads of <a href="http://www.shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great properties in Malta</a> that you can rent out for the event! </span>

<h3><strong>2. <b>Rock out with Red Electrick</b></strong></h3>
https://www.facebook.com/events/1520902357999172/

<span style="font-weight:400;">Get your tickets sorted and get ready for what promises to be a fabulous night out at Hugo’s Terrace! Home-grown talent, Red Electrick, are set to give you a truly spectacular performance, and you’ll love getting dressed up, snapping loads of photos, and sipping on those sinfully good cocktails. </span>

<h3><strong>3. <b>#Throwback at Tattingers </b></strong></h3>
http://https//www.facebook.com/events/849017055268100/

<span style="font-weight:400;">Party and raise your glasses to the sound of the 80s and 90s, expertly mixed by Djs Clint Bajada, Alfred Zammit, Noel Camilleri, and Chris Funkytown. As you dance your way to midnight and beyond at Tattingers, perched just on the side of the historic Rabat, you’ll be filled with nostalgia for the parties of the past, and buzzing with excitement for the year to come all at once. Cheers!</span>

<h3><strong>4. <b>A Royal NYE in Valletta</b></strong></h3>
https://www.facebook.com/events/543832645956733/

<span style="font-weight:400;">Hit Kingsway in our gorgeous capital city for a fancy night out featuring jazz and electro-swing music, divine canapés, and all the sumptuous cocktails and drinks you’ll need to celebrate the New Year. </span>

<h3><strong>6. </strong><b>Winter Wine Night</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight:400;">If you’d rather do something a little more low key with your significant other or maybe just a few loved ones, then book yourself a table at one of the island’s favourite wine bars for a night filled with good conversation, fine wine, and your other great loves: cheeseboards and close friends. If you’re not sure where to go, here are a few of our personal favourites when it comes to wine nights:</span>

            [blog_content] => After all the presents have been unwrapped, chocolates have been eaten, and bottles of wine and champagne have been drained dry, it’s hard to imagine that there could be any more fun to be had over the Christmas season! But let’s not forget about the other days of Christmas break – sure, we don't all get to enjoy an extensive period of festive recess, but for those who do, there’s time to be filled! Not sure what to do other than sit at home and watch festive cartoons? Here are just a few ideas to get you started.
<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong>Have a Movie Marathon</strong></h3>
No matter what your go-to favourite genre may be, a movie marathon at home in your cosiest pyjamas is just heavenly. Use your turkey-and-stuffing leftovers, line up your snack hoard (we recommend popcorn, your favourite crisps, Oreos, some cheeses, <em>galletti </em>and a selection of hams) and treat yourself and your friendly or family members to a day of simple and well-deserved self-indulgence.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/nHLvt59LGHo1W/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>2. Watch The Comedy Knights: Show me the money! at Teatru Salesjan</strong></h3>
There’s nothing like a good laugh to burn those naughty Christmas calories, so get your tickets to what promises to be The Comedy Knights’ best show yet! 2017 was absolutely packed with political intrigue and saucy scandals, so get ready for some seriously good local satire.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/CoDp6NnSmItoY/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Hit the Baystreet Ice Rink</strong></h3>
Perfect if you’re looking for a spot of festive family fun, ice skating is one of the quirkier things to do in Malta given that we enjoy such a relatively warm Mediterranean climate! Don’t worry if you fall flat on your softer parts once or twice - everyone does that, all that matters is that you get up and try again.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o7TKzkhLYrvcUYd1K/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>4. </strong><strong>Spend a day with Sea Creatures and Beautiful Birds</strong></h3>
Treat yourself to the perfect <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/bird-park-aquarium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animal lover’s tour</a>  that’ll take you to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/bird-park-malta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BirdPark Malta</a>  to see some stunning creatures, from elegant pink flamingos to regal swans, wise owls, rainbow-coloured parrots and more! Next, you’ll head to the Malta National Aquarium located along one of our island’s most scenic promenades; with a whopping 26 display tanks and more fish than you could possibly name at one go, you’ll definitely enjoy learning all about marine life, getting to know them up close and personal.

<h3><strong>5. </strong><strong>Explore Buskett Gardens</strong></h3>
A trip to the lush Buskett Gardens is never a bad idea! This 16th century forest is arguably one of the most beautiful places on our little island, and is the perfect place for a long, relaxing walk away from all the technological distractions back home. If the weather is fine, take things to the next level and turn your wintery walk into a cheeky picnic, complete with a big thermos of something hot to drink, snack, and a football to kick about. If the weather is on the wetter side, then head over to Mdina to enjoy some pure Maltese history - and something tasty from Fontanella cafe, a local favourite.

This dish is perfect for Winter, but would make a great Summer dish too, especially paired with an ice-cold Cisk! The Maltese way is to cook until crispy, however you can modify this method as you prefer.

            [blog_content] => “Brodu” is so much more than a simple chicken stock in Malta.  It’s a hearty meal, with 2 courses,  a delicious broth soup, and then the chicken itself, served with steamed/boiled vegetables, potatoes and crusty bread.
Ingredients:
2 carrots
2 onions
some Celery (leaves and small stalks only if possible,
in Maltese it's "karfus" and you get it for free from all
the veggie men)
Qarabali (Zucchini/courgettes) - 2 small-medium ones.
Mixed herbs (I used Herbes de Provence but you
can use Italian mix, or just thyme if you like)
Salt, pepper, olive oil.
3 or 4 garlic cloves
I whole chicken, with neck/giblets included

Method:
Wash and dry the chicken, trimming off all the visible fat and if you choose, remove the skin.

Prepare a pot big enough to fit the chicken comfortably. Put the heat on low, add olive oil, and chuck in the chopped carrots, onions, celery zucchini and garlic.

Cover and "sweat" for a few minutes until the onions are slightly translucent.

Add the whole chicken, and pour enough water to just cover it. No more! You can always add a bit more later.

Add some herbs, and a generous amount of salt and pepper. A couple of bay-leaves never hurt either! :)

Bring to the boil, then cover and let simmer for at least an hour, until the chicken is very tender and you can pull off a piece easily with a fork.

To serve, remove the chicken carefully and bring the soup back to a rolling boil.

Add a handful of rice as soon as the soup comes to a boil, cook until tender and serve with plenty of lemon juice.

The 2nd course is usually boiled potatoes and spinach/zucchini or other fresh green veggies, all drizzled with lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil.

Some people add potatoes to this soup also, which is fine, but somehow I prefer this one without potato. When it's beef, I like to add potatoes (not when using it as a stock though).

Chicken stock/just the brodu:

To make "just" a stock or to serve just a soup without having to use a whole chicken, use the carcass of a chicken, plus a couple of necks and some giblets. These are available for dirt cheap from your butcher. When I make coq au vin and joint the chicken myself, I keep the carcass, neck and giblets for this very purpose.

Use the same amount of stock vegetables.

To serve as a soup: When the soup is done, remove the carcass, allow to cool slightly and remove any meat and add them back to the pot.

To use as a stock: Remove all the carcass and bones, discard (or use bits of chicken for another dish or sandwiches), strain soup and discard vegetables and bits. The liquid can be frozen and used at a later date. This also works well with roast chicken carcasses/bones with some meat on them.

Happy cooking! :)

                )

            [blog_content] => A quick word of friendly advice in this new year - never underestimate the power of team building activities. When you spend twenty to forty hours a week working alongside the same group of people, it’s super important to spend some time fostering friendships and building stronger bonds with your colleagues - it doesn’t matter if you’re having a cup of tea together in the break room or binge-watching your favourite series together after hours.

It’s no secret that a team that gets on well together socially <strong>works </strong>well! That means a happier office, better company culture, and improved efficiency across the board. In short: there’s no reason <em>not </em>to organise awesome team building days out, and who knows? You might end up finding friends for life right there in your office. Planning your next team building activity? Here are a few ideas that’ll help make it a memorable event.
<h3><strong>1. Segway Tour</strong></h3>
The perfect way to share so many laughs your cheeks will hurt while doing some speedy sightseeing, <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/segway-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going on a segway tour in Malta</a>  is sure to be a big winner with all your workmates! What’s a segway you ask? Well, it’s a type of two-wheeled scooter that works using your body weight for balance. Simple lean forward to accelerate, and ease up on the foot pedals to slow down or stop. From sweeping views of the Mediterranean sea from Dingli Cliffs, right up to the architectural majesty of our amazing capital, Valletta, you’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to choosing the right route for your team.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/tMoEdojMsxzZS/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>2. Quad Biking</strong></h3>
If segways aren’t <em>quite </em>your cup of tea, then perhaps a bit of <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/quad-bikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quad biking</a>  is what your clan of colleagues needs. A fair bit more intense than segway tours or badger karting, quad bikes are for the more adventurous folks out there! It doesn’t matter if you’re a seasoned rider or are just trying it out for the first time - one thing’s for certain: quad biking will definitely get the adrenaline pumping and smiles spreading across some very happy faces.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/WHTbaAQpcgbIc/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>3. Escape Rooms </strong></h3>
A particular favourite of the wannabe-Sherlocks out there, <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escape rooms</a> offer a very different type of challenge - one that needs more brain than brawn. Get your teams together and use your combined wit, brainpower, and deductive skills to make your way to freedom in an Egyptian Adventure, Mozart’s Mystery, or Secret Surgery Room! All you need to bring is your teamwork and your A-game. Warning: may test the bonds of friendship.

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o7TKT0XDElcmlCeNa/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>4. Office Trivia/Pub Quiz </strong></h3>
This one’s best mixed in with a good old-fashioned Pub Quiz-style affair, planned as part of day full of team building fun of your choosing. You’ll need to spend some time thinking up some clever questions, and use the internet for any general knowledge questions. You’ll also need a designated quizmaster, some rules, and a small prize for the winning team!

<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/8qvSwj9qlinqo/giphy.webp" />
<h3><strong>5. Karaoke Party </strong></h3>
There’s nothing quite as cheerful, noisy, and guaranteed to make you giggle as a good old-fashioned karaoke night - especially after a fully day out and about with your workmates and with a few well-earned drinks. It doesn’t matter if you can’t hold a note to save your lie - that’s part of the fun! If you’re feeling self-conscious, go for popular classics like the tunes from Grease and Abba. That way, everyone will be up singing with you!

            [blog_content] => <em>Qarabagħli </em>- marrows or courgettes, are a staple in Maltese kitchens, one of those vegetables that are ever present on your <em>Nanna</em>'s countertop. By far the most traditional Maltese way to cook these versatile vegetables is by stuffing them and baking them, resulting in the mouth-wateringly good <em>Qarabagħli Mimli fil-Forn.</em>

            [blog_content] => Ah, the ever-popular <em>Stuffat</em>, the dish that screams at you from every Maltese restaurant's menu - boasting to be Malta's national dish. Well, it practically is our national dish, and most of us do eat it every Sunday, religiously. The <em>Stuffat</em> can be enjoyed during Winter or Summer, as a first course and as a second course. And it tastes unequivocally Maltese. Why not try your hand and making Malta's national dish yourself?

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4016" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/stuffat-tal-fenek-2.jpeg" alt="stuffat tal fenek 2.jpeg" width="640" height="375" />

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

1 rabbit, (approx 1.5kg, cut in small portions)
2 onions, chopped
4 garlic cloves, peeled
5 large tomatoes
2 tsp kunserva (tomato paste)
5 potatoes, peeled and quartered
3 carrots, peeled and chopped
200 g peas (fresh or canned)
6 bay leaves
Pinch mixed herbs
Freshly ground pepper amp; Salt to season
500ml red wine
1 tsp olive oil

<strong>Method</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Marinate the rabbit overnight in the red wine (marinade to include the garlic, garlic, salt amp; pepper</li>
	<li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil, and add the rabbit until slightly brown.</li>
	<li>Add the onions, carrots, potatoes and the tomatoes, and pour half of the marinade on the ingredients.</li>
	<li>Bring to boil on a high flame for about 15 minutes</li>
	<li>Add the remaining wine, peas, bay leaves, kidney and liver and simmer on low heat for about 2 hours, stir occasionally and add some more wine if the sauce begins to dry up.</li>
	<li>Cooking variations - you can choose to make the rabbit stew to look browner by reducing the number of tomatoes and kunserva use, I personally prefer the rabbit stew to have very little tomato past even if it is served with spaghetti.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Spaghetti with rabbit sauce as a starter</strong>

Boil some spaghetti (leave al dente) Cover with some sauce from the rabbit stew, do not add any rabbit pieces if you are serving rabbit stew as a main course, but you can add some of the rabbit liver to the sauce serving Finely grated Parmesan cheese can be added on top.
<em>Happy Cooking!</em>

                )

            [blog_content] => 2017 is over and done with, and people all over the world are looking ahead and making plans that promise to make their 2018 their best year yet. Sound great, right? Well, the thing about those pesky New Year’s Resolutions is that year after year (without fail), we make loads of promises to ourselves with the very best of intentions – but how many of these resolutions do we <strong>actually </strong>keep? The secret to making – and sticking to – your New Year’s Resolutions lies in keeping them simple, and above all being realistic about them. Here are just a few examples that might inspire your plans for 2018!
<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong>Try something new</strong></h3>
This one’s nice and easy, and just perfect if you struggle with keeping your resolutions (to be read: perfect if you’re the kind of person who gives up three days into the New Year). It can be as ‘small’ as trying a type of cuisine that you didn’t think you’d like, learning a new skill or language, or maybe even pushing yourself to try something way outside your comfort zone, like <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scuba diving</a> or<a href="https://www.funmalta.com/rock-climbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> rock climbing </a>in Malta! Who knows – you might end up discovering a new hobby while you’re at it.

<h3><strong>2. </strong><strong>Read more books</strong></h3>
You don’t need to be a full-on literature fanatic to appreciate a good read! Cut down on the time you spend online and create space for yourself to curl up with a good book more often in 2018. It’s an excellent way to unwind after a stressful day at work or school, enrich your vocabulary, and become immersed in another world for a while. If you struggle with longer reads, why not try a collection of short stories or some poetry?

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc-jyQhh7iv/?tagged=bookworm/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Be kinder to yourself</strong></h3>
This one sounds easy at first, but can be quite a challenge. Sometimes, we can be our own worst critics, and we wouldn’t even dream of saying half the things we say to ourselves to the people we care about. So why should you say them to yourself? The answer is: you shouldn’t. Being kind to yourself is about treating yourself with the love and respect your give your nearest and dearest; it’s about claiming the time and space you need for self-care. You’re important! Recharge. Relax. You’ll feel happier and more motivated for it.

<h3><strong>4. </strong><strong>Forget about your phone</strong></h3>
Attention all smartphone addicts: it’s time to spend less time on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or Tinder and more time being totally present when you’re (meant to be) enjoying someone’s company! If you’ve made plans to hang out with your friends, family, or significant other, then put the phone away. You’re not going to miss anything important on social media, we promise. You could, however, be missing out on precious real-life moments and memories if you don’t!

<h3><strong>5. </strong><strong>Declutter your life</strong></h3>
The start of a new year is like opening a fresh new copybook at the start of the scholastic year: full of promise and potential – but not if your desk is overflowing with papers, pens, and a Pandora’s Box-worth of chaos. Purge your wardrobe of the clothes you simply don’t wear (why not donate them?), tidy your workspace at home <em>and </em>in the office, and give your life an early spring clean to make sure you start 2018 with less mess and more organisation.

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">Welcome to 2018, ladies and gentlemen! Now that we’ve had a few days’ break to recover from all the fun and frivolity that come with the festive season, this is as good a time as any to start filling our brand-new calendars with the first few events of the year. From photography and music to ballet and beyond, take a look at 8 of our top picks for things to do in Malta this January.</span>

The series of photographs offers a poignant glimpse into the lives of displaced people in stateless communities from around the world, challenging the viewer to ask some hard questions about discrimination, ethnicity, religion, privilege, social injustice, and our role in the grand scheme of things.</span>

            [blog_content] => Any avid traveller could tell you that there’s no place like Malta. Some may call a trip to Malta a refreshing experience, others… cultural shock. From our loud, passionate natives, to our less than smooth roads (even the Italian actress Monica Bellucci, who came to spend the New Year, commented on how “disastrous” they are), and let us not forget our transport system which leaves much to be desired. We can safely say that our island is quite…different.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l49JQIushQig2JHcQ/giphy.gif" />

Yet for all the negatives, there are definitely positives. Your dear blogger has just come back from a long holiday abroad, and she can safely say that there truly is no place like home. From the sinfully delicious smell of pastizzi wafting down every main street to the friendly, loud “Orrajt, kif ahna?” (translation: how are you?”) booming out of the shop owners’ mouths when visiting any establishment- the Maltese way of life speaks to my soul.

<img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/O6VoexTrRs6eQ/giphy.gif" />

Safe to say, this blog is a celebration of everything which is genuinely, uniquely and endearingly Maltese.

<b>1. Those Sunny Island days</b>

Malta has the famous “Mediterranean Climate”- which can only mean one thing- sun, sun, sun, and more sun! Due to our islands’ high daylight hours, Malta enjoys approximately 3,000 hours of daylight and sunshine each year- an average of 5 hours in December and 12 hours in July. That’s a heck of a lot of tanning time! Consequently, our waters are very warm, boasting of an average of 20◦C- perfect for those who love beach-y holidays. Now you know exactly what to pack for your next trip to Malta.

<b>2. Our love of Fireworks and Festas</b>

Love them or hate them, Maltese Festas are here to stay. Almost every weekend during the summer season, a village in Malta and/or Gozo celebrates a patron saint. This usually means that the village square is full of lights, live bands, bars, food stalls, and…you’ve guessed it, fireworks. The Festa day usually starts as early as 9am with petards, continuing well into the night with a firework show, exhibiting aerial and ground fireworks. If you're visiting Malta within the summer season, expect your nights to be lit by fireworks.

<b>3. Our Language </b>

Fun fact: our language is made up of many variants of languages reflecting our country’s past conquerors; we say that 80% of the language is an old variant of Arabic, and the remaining 20% of it is a mix of Italian, French, Spanish and English. We’re often told that we sound angry when we speak our native Maltese, yet don’t be fooled- we’re probably just discussing what we’re going to eat for dinner. We’re just passionate. If you want to learn the odd yet useful Maltese phrase, check this <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2017/11/22/6-maltese-phrases-for-your-next-trip-to-malta/">post </a>and <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2016/11/18/seven-essential-maltese-phrases-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>.

<b>4. Our Megalithic Temples</b>

Our prehistoric temples are definitely unique in the world- so unique in fact that some have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites (namely the Ġgantija temples, Hagar Qim, Mnajdra, Ta’ Hagrat temples, Skorba temples and Tarxien temples). They are said to be the oldest free-standing structures on Earth, the oldest being the several temples built during the Ġgantija phase (3600–3000 BC). Definitely, a majestic site that is not to be missed when visiting the island.

<b>5. Our Food</b>

You knew this was coming. Arguably the most important point mentioned in this blog, our food is pretty much what makes us Maltese. From Nanna’s cooking to the yummy oily comforting selection found at the local village pastizzeria, our food is truly unique. We have something for everyone- “gbejna”, the local cheese made out of salted sheep milk (for the cheese fans), and “pastizzi”, our response to America’s fast food- cheap, hot out of the oven, available everywhere and obviously delicious. We also offer our “Twistees”, a crunchy cheesy snack, and “Kinnie”, our herbal soft drink. Finally, we have our Cisk, our home-brewed beer. Make sure to leave room in your luggage to pack some of our delicacies for home!

            [blog_content] => "western">Sliema, the shoppers’ mecca of Malta, the high-rise array rising up from the sea, dwarfing smaller structures with her imperious heights. It is hard to imagine that one can find peaceful spots in this bustling city, with its constant flow of traffic and its myriad of shoppers and businesses. Yet if you look closely enough, and if you know where to look, Sliema might just surprise you with her underlying charm, and provide you with some truly awe-inspiring views and experiences. Ready to deviate from the beaten track and embark on an off-road journey of Sliema?
"western" ><strong>1. Fort Tigne</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb1ivYMHuht/?hl=enamp;taken-by=forttigne/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >No typo there – we are talking about Tigne – yet it is the solitary fort which catches our eye. Engulfed by the gigantic apartment buildings and the shopping centre, Fort Tigne mostly goes unnoticed. Yet this quaint fort has been a stronghold since 1792, when it was built by the Knights of St John. One of its first tasks was defending Malta against Napoleon’s attack in 1798, and it was then put to use by the British, during their 200-year rule of Malta. It is now being restored to its original state, and offers unobstructed views of Valletta’s iconic skyline. It takes a while to find, but it’s SO worth it.
"western" ><strong>2. Take in the Views from the Skyroom Bar at Preluna Hotel</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BDmNWkhKtPx/?hl=enamp;tagged=preluna/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >The Preluna Hotel had in itself been a landmark for a substantial part of Maltese history, being the highest building in the area for many years. It has now been surpassed by many other buildings, yet the view from the Skyroom bar on the 13<sup>th</sup> floor is still jaw-droppingly beautiful. Sip on some cocktails at sunset and snap away to your heart’s content as golden hour veils over the city – be careful not to look down if you’re afraid of heights!
"western" ><strong>3. Escape the crowds at an <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room">Escape Room</a></strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BDNyzf4tkVG/?hl=enamp;taken-by=scavengermalta/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Sliema can feel a little too crowded sometimes, and the best way to beat the crowds is to engage in a fun activity which will also give your brain a workout, all in the company of your friends. While you’ll be trying to escape the room in an hour or less, you will also be escaping the scurrying crowds outside. It is also the perfect solution to a rainy day or even a stifling hot day! There’s nothing an <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room">escape room</a> adventure <!-- https://www.funmalta.com/escape-room -->can’t fix.
"western" ><strong>4. Roam the backstreets of Sliema</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb9qHk9hcu9/?hl=enamp;tagged=preluna/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >While Sliema puts up a modern and futuristic façade, its heart and soul lie in its backstreets – the quiet Sliema of olden days. You can start exploring any backstreet you wish, however, we do recommend finding Freres Street and then getting lost from there. You’ll be surprised at the sheer amount of picturesque Maltese balconies that can be found here, as well as narrow little streets which wind down maze-like. It is actually surprising that a quiet break from Sliema lies just beyond its main streets, yet few people actually bother to look.

"western" ><strong>5. Cuddle with cats at Independence Garden</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BC3maL4SvSv/?taken-by=mymalta.guide/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western"><a name="_GoBack"></a>If you crave some feline attention, head to Independence Garden, where perched on one of the sheltered benches you’ll find a small cat haven. These cats are regularly fed and have cosy blankets and cushions to sleep on, and are blissfully happy with a cuddle or two. When life gets a bit too much, it Is always helpful to cuddle a furry friend; whether you are feeling lonely or sad, or you just want to spend a few playful minutes (or hours, we won’t judge) in the marvellous company of cats. You’ll recognise the garden by the Egyptian-like statue of a colourful cat perched over the garden’s wooden gazebo.

            [blog_content] => "western" >Valletta has become one of Malta’s most hip cities in the past few years. This year it is set out to be more in vogue than ever, while graciously bearing the title of European City of Culture 2018. Cool new shops and restaurants are popping up in Valletta every week, and while they may be fun to discover, they surely do attract some crowds! So what to do if you prefer to visit a quieter side to this city? You get off the beaten track!
"western" >Now Valletta is a diminutive city to say the least, so you will be able to go through the locations on this list in one day – maybe even in one afternoon if you’re determined. Get your cameras (or phones) at the ready, and slide off Republic Street into the beautiful, still relatively unknown, parts of the city.
"western" ><strong>1. Visit the Siege Bell Memorial</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdzKY9jh8wz/?hl=enamp;taken-at=219990830/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >The Siege Bell Memorial lies at the farthermost tip of the Valletta peninsula, perched high on the Castille bastion, greeting and bidding farewell to anyone entering or exiting the Grand Harbour. The Memorial commemorates soldiers buried at sea during the two world wars, and features a solemn bell and a statue of an unknown soldier in eternal rest. The Memorial is directly behind the Lower Barrakka Gardens, and while it does attract some attention, it never amasses the crowds that places like the Upper Barrakka are known for (especially in the summer) – even though the views from here are breathtaking!
"western" ><strong>2. Walk Valletta’s Coast</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BBP4aFdvd2H/?hl=enamp;tagged=vallettabridge/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Moving on from the Memorial, you’ll find a steep flight of steps leading you down to the seashore, just in front of The Mediterranean Conference Centre. Once down by the sea, you can enjoy a rocky walk upon Valletta’s rugged coast, getting up close and personal with the bright red breakwater on a seaside adventure in the city. The St. Elmo breakwater bridge was originally constructed in 1903, yet was given a new lease on life in 2012, making it a striking feature in our natural harbour. The walk takes you around the circumference of the Valletta peninsula, however, be careful - waves may become dangerous, especially during storms. Also, make sure that your shoes are not slippery, or you might end up enjoying an unplanned swim!
"western" ><strong>3. Check out il-Mandragg</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQirtrgljSu/?hl=enamp;tagged=mandragg/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Il-Mandragg is a neighbourhood in Valletta which can be found in the backstreets of the area where the Sliema ferry berths. It was an area known for squalor and poverty during the war, cluttered with diminutive apartments built so high and so close to each other that they blocked the sun’s rays from reaching the streets. The area has now been given new life, thanks to years of regeneration and beautification; however, it still remains hauntingly beautiful in a way that the rest of Valletta isn’t. Il-Mandragg is a part of Valletta which is still quite raw yet bursting with life; it is the area where most Valletta locals live, and it has a totally different feel from the Valletta found on Republic Street.
"western" ><strong>4.Grab a bite at Is-Suq tal-Belt</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdpOt8djJMY/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1034133268/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Finally! Valletta has its own artisan market, housed in an authentic, Victorian-era building which used to be the main food market in Valletta for over a 100 years. Following other cities’ footsteps, Valletta has re-opened its wrought-iron market gates, and transformed a dingy, run-down warehouse into the fantastic example of Victorian architecture it is today. Don’t worry, it won’t just be your Instagram feed thanking you – the food here is truly something else! Your stomach will be eternally grateful when checking out all the different stalls – from humble pastizzi, to elaborate Asian food. Naturally, it tastes that much better when washed down with an ice-cold Cisk while people watching at Strada Merkanti.
"western" ><strong>5. Go underground at Lascaris War Rooms</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BT_O6PCFAA0/?hl=enamp;taken-at=967960174/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Before heading out of Valletta, check out the underground world of Lascaris War Rooms, a series of corridors and chambers which had been used as the headquarters of defence of Malta during the Second World War. Pretty cool huh? It’s even cooler once you see the perfectly preserved rooms, still equipped with humungous maps of Sicily and Malta and with vintage wartime equipment. You’ll be transported back to the 1940s while on this underground adventure beneath the streets of the city, and your Instagram feed will thank you for it, mark our words.

            [blog_content] => The humble orange. As an island located smack dab in the middle of the Mediterranean sea, Malta commands a truly enviable climate for growing citrus fruits! At the right time of the year, you can buy crates of oranges at ridiculously good prices - so sometimes you might find that you’ve got far more fruit than you can actually eat before letting it go bad. Realistically, there’s only so much Vitamin C one person can take in each day! Not sure what to do with all your surplus citrus? We’ve got you covered with a bunch of different ideas.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd2vmoAFbk8/?tagged=oranges/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<strong>1. Brew up some orange and clove tea</strong>

Perfect for the colder months, orange and clove tea will warm your soul and leave you feeling cleansed and quite refreshed. Oh, and this brew is said to help ease stomach cramps!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdcl6bwjJE0/?tagged=orangeherbaltea/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<strong>2. DIY potpourri</strong>

Yep, you read right! You can use dried citrus peel to make your very own potpourri, saving you money and making sure you used every bit of the fruit.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcfAFMnheiW/?tagged=potpourri/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<strong>3. Make some marmalade</strong>

A little more advanced (but a deliciously satisfying challenge!), making your own marmalade is one of the best uses for oranges. Marmalade adds zing to your toast and zest to your crumpets, and you can boast about how you’ve made your own.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd-IO4eFW-F/?tagged=marmalade/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<strong>4. Add flavour to your water</strong>

Struggle to drink ‘plain’ water? Granted, it’s not the most exciting drink in the world, but staying hydrated is vital to staying healthy and keeping your skin looking great. Add a couple of slices of orange to your water bottle, give it a shake, and voila - tasty, vitamin-infused water that isn’t a chore to drink.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdzTsiIFdXy/?tagged=orangewater/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<strong>5. Make some mouth-watering desserts</strong>

From slices of sinfully-good citrus cake to refreshing home-made granitas, crunchy biscuits, cute cupcakes and beyond, you’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to finding the perfect sweet treat to make with your oranges. Here’s a list of citrusy delights to get you started. Ready? Set. Bake! Don’t forget to send us a piece.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd-GVOnjk8l/?tagged=orangecake/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<strong>6. Make a natural orange-scented cleaner</strong>

If you want to cut down on waste and chemicals in your life, then this one’s for you. All you need is a mason jar, orange peels, white vinegar, and some time. Stuff the peels into the jar and cover in vinegar; close the jar (make sure it’s sealed shut) and shake it every couple of days for two weeks. You’re done! Clean away.

<strong><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HIrYP4RI9DpLy/giphy.gif" /></strong>
<strong>7. Treat yourself with an orange peel face mask</strong>

Get your skin looking and feeling refreshed with an orange peel mask! Simply grind the dried peel into a powder (you can use a pestle and mortar for this) and add an equal amount of water or milk until you can mix it into a paste. Voila! Done.
<strong><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IydQxUwzX6ky1q0/giphy.gif" /></strong>
<strong>8. Exfoliate!</strong>

Another mini-spa treatment, use the same dried orange peels (you can dry them in the sun or oven) and grind them up with chickpea flour to make a lovely exfoliator that’ll cleanse your face and/or body. And you’ll smell delicious too.

            [blog_content] => While we may be blessed with more sunny winter days than many of our European friends, we still get the odd cold snap, chilly night, or wet week from time to time. Enter, delicious soul-warming soup that isn’t just comforting, but healthy, delicious, and really quite cheap to make. The ‘soppa ta’ l-armla’ or ‘widow’s soup’ is a traditionally-Maltese, vegetarian dish that gets its name from the fact that the ingredients are cheap (it was actually what you would call a ‘poor man’s dish!). One of the best things about this hearty soup? It’s extremely easy to make. Grab a bowl and spoon because we’re going to get cooking.
Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 onion</li>
	<li>3 or 4 cloves of garlic</li>
	<li>1 onion</li>
	<li>2 potatoes</li>
	<li>2 celery sticks</li>
	<li>2 carrots</li>
	<li>1 kohlrabi</li>
	<li>1 cup podded broad beans</li>
	<li>1 cup peas</li>
	<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
	<li>1 tbsp butter</li>
	<li>1/2 a cauliflower</li>
	<li>1 1/2 tbsp tomato pasta</li>
	<li>Vegetable stock</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
	<li>6 soft gbejniet (Maltese goat’s cheese)</li>
</ul>
Method
1. Wash all the vegetables; peel and chop the potatoes, carrots, and kohlrabi. Slice the celery, crush the garlic cloves, and cut the cauliflower into small, bite-sized pieces. Roughly chop the parsley.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/zsRviQEWP9SHm/giphy.gif" />
2. In a large, deep saucepan, heat the oil and butter together before tipping in the onion, garlic, and majority of the parsley. Sauté, stirring frequently until soft.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/demgpwJ6rs2DS/giphy.gif" />
3. Add the rest of the vegetables, tomato paste, and stock. Stir well before seasoning with salt and pepper.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/73UW5Rfo2osRq/giphy.gif" />
4. Bring soup to the boil and leave it to simmer for around 15 to 20 minutes until the vegetables are cooked through.
5. Add the gbejniet (goat’s cheese) to the soup such that they’re slightly submerged. Cover the saucepan and continue cooking for a couple more minutes so that the cheese has some time to warm up.

6. Throw in the remaining parsley and stir well.
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/rkgX9MTBXJa1O/giphy.gif" />
7. Serve in bowls, with one portion of cheese to each one.

            [blog_content] => "western">There are many facets to Maltese culture; one which we are immensely proud of is our colourful and vast music scene. One might think that we limit ourselves to the yearly Eurovision entry, or our traditional “Għana”, but in reality, our national talent stretches far beyond that. Here are some local bands that are making an impact in (and beyond) Malta this year:
"western" ><b>1. Mistura</b>
"western" >Mistura is a Maltese band to be proud of: their lyrics are composed solely in Maltese, and whilst being politically motivated, they set out to make their listeners think and contemplate current affairs, in and beyond the island. Meet the band: Antonio Olivari is behind the thought-provoking lyrics (and some pretty funky guitar riffs), Malcolm Bonnici is the lead singer/ guitarist/ lyricist and official jokester of the group, Matthew Agius is the laid back and groovy bassist, and Mark Andrew Azzopardi is the drummer/ eye-candy of the band. Their musical genre is a nostalgic mix of classic rock with a funky twist, reminiscent of Pink Floyd, Queen, Muse, Radiohead, amongst other influences. You could catch their live performance on the 19th of January in Valletta for Valletta 2018’s Opening Week for Music and Theatre, at Sala San Duminku Community Theatre.

"western" ><b>2. Eyes to Argus</b>
"western" >With a new album launched in October 2017, this band is on a steep ascent to fame amongst avid Maltese music connoisseurs, and it is safe to say that they’re well on the way to achieving international popularity. The band was founded in 2013, by Samwel Mallia, Ben Mifsud Joslin and Robert Farrugia. The drummer/ percussionist Kristian Schembri joined the band in 2015. Eyes to Argus offer an experimental and atmospheric sound, with influences ranging from post-rock to jazz, Radiohead to Russian Circles; yet the aim has always been to set a mood for audiences, rather than confining the band to a set genre. Check their new album “VEER”, out on Spotify <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eUiqqAzeTcPsNCC8zoopG">here</a>, or catch them on the 23rd and 24th of February 2018, at the Valletta Campus Theatre, opening for the Italian post-rock outfit Mokadelic.

"western" ><b>3. Fuzzhoneys </b>
"western" >The “Femmetastic” (their appropriately named second EP) girl duo band “Fuzzhoneys” is comprised of Francesca (guitar/vocals) and Caroline (drums/tambourine). It was founded way back in 2012, the typical story of two music fanatics who found that they share a mutual love and understanding of The Doors, The Beatles, Blur, The White Stripes and The Black Keys, amongst others. Their biography immediately sets out a motto for the band, “no rules, but to express”, and their sound has been described as “DIY”- a solely unique. Their debut EP was aptly named “Tal-Genn”, a Maltese phrase meaning “amazing”, and truly it is just that and more. They are currently touring the UK, follow their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fuzzhoneys/">Facebook page</a> for more updates on their adventures!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcdAP9FA-Fa/?taken-by=fuzzhoneys/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><b>4. Plato’s Dream Machine</b>
"western" >This Maltese band has been around since 2009, developing and evolving ever since. Members came and went, yet Robert Farrugia Flores (the band’s lead vocals and lyricist) consistently stuck to the band, and now, together with Mark Abela, Samwel Grima, Francesco Sultana and Daniel Sant, the band is in ship-shape and ready to perform. Their cited influences are Atoms for Peace, Radiohead and Leonard Cohen amongst others, and their main genre is synth-pop. Catch them on the 3rd of March at The Garage, Zebbug, for a live performance, and listen to their highly acclaimed second album entitled “GUF” on spotify!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BXR81t8F2K_/?tagged=platosdreammachine/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><b>5. The Violent Violets</b>
"western" >This three piece band, comprised of André Farrugia on bass, Matthew Shields on guitar and vocals, and Samuel Xiberras on drums, started out in 2009, but the members knew each other way back from when they were students at a secondary school in Malta. They’ve since evolved into a post-punk/alternative band, performing live for the first time in 2011, and had later found themselves performing with local bands and even international artists, such as Joe Gideon amp; The Shark and Tall Ships. Their debut album, entitled “Tame”, came out in 2014, to raving reviews. They’re currently rehearsing and writing new material, so keep an eye out for them this year!

            [blog_content] => "western" >St Julian’s is Malta’s most concentrated touristic and entertainment hub, buzzing with tourists and locals, especially during the summer months. It might seem impossible to picture a quiet spot in this city of the night, however, there are some quaint places which won’t be as crowded as the Paceville steps, or St George’s bay at any hour of a summer day. Need a breather from all the partying? Then check out these 5 calming, and mostly uncrowded spots!
"western"><strong>1. The small beach off of Wilga Street (overlooking Dragonara Casino)</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdnwFNxjIgz/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >You can start your journey in Paceville, the so-named city of peace, which is truly anything but. Stroll down Wilga Street until its very end and you’ll end up in a small but pretty rocky beach, overlooking the flashing ‘Casino’ sign. This beach is a far cry from the stifling, huddled flock that St George’s Bay becomes from the earliest signs of summer (that is, April). Although it does still attract some people, it is a much quieter option. It can also be spectacularly beautiful during the Winter, when crashing waves upon the rocks make beautiful displays.
"western"><strong>2. The Millennium Chapel</strong>
"western">[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BPu90tBBtBr/?hl=enamp;tagged=milleniumchapel/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >I am sure that most of the people visiting St Julian’s and Paceville have no idea that the area is home to an oasis of peace, which in itself is housed in a modern architectural masterpiece by the famed Richard England. Found on the aptly named Triq il-Knisja (Church Street), the Millennium Chapel is open day and night and welcomes anyone needing a moment of quiet in the fast-paced tempo of the town outside its doors. Regardless of religion, this modern marvel is a sight to see, if only for its architectural value.
"western"><strong>3. Hilton Yacht Marina</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdsBkMDhf5o/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >A couple of hundred metres straight on from the Chapel, as you come to the roundabout, you’ll notice a staircase on your left, leading to Portomaso Marina. This delightful area hosts a multitude of restaurants – perfect for a spot of lunch – and offers some serious yacht eye-candy. Grab a bite to eat and stroll around the luxury yachts after lunch, where you can savour the serenity of this little microcosm in the heart of busy St Julian’s.
"western"><strong>4. Walk along Spinola Bay</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdvTp09h0D3/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><a name="_GoBack"></a>As you exit Portomaso Marina, take the first left on the roundabout, leading you down to Triq Spinola. From here you can go further down to the coast, for a picturesque view of Spinola Bay, the more traditional side of St Julian’s. From here you’ll also get a beautiful view of the whole Balluta and Spinola area, perfect for some dazzling photos of the Mediterranean! This area is also known for its cat village, which is exactly what its name implies - a feline-friendly space where you can interact with some gorgeous kitties!
"western"><strong>5. People-watching at Pjazza Balluta</strong>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd0eIETnbmU/?hl=enamp;taken-at=3798792/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Grab a coffee and find a comfortable bench from where you can admire the diverse architecture at Balluta Bay, as well as the motley crowds of passers-by strolling along the seaside. Balluta Bay is in itself a charming sight to behold, and the wide varieties of people which walk its banks make it an even more interesting location!

            [blog_content] => "western" >With the passing of January, Malta descends into a state of revelry and colourful frenzy, as social norms are bent during the five days of Carnival. The Maltese, as they tend to do about everything else, put their heart and soul into this jovial five day feast; some even start planning for these days a whole year in advance. Let us guide you through the nitty gritty of Carnival in Malta – from where it all started, to what will happen this weekend.


[caption id="attachment_4129" align="alignnone" width="1600"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4129" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/carival-float.jpg" alt="SONY DSC" width="1600" height="1065" /> SONY DSC[/caption]
"western"><b>History</b>
"western" >The word carnival derives from the Italian words ‘carne vale’ which literally means ‘meat is allowed’. During the five days of Carnival meat and lavish food could be enjoyed before the 40 days of abstaining during Lent, where meat was renounced and more humble food was consumed, before the joyous feast of Easter. This fasting period was anticipated by 5 days of gluttony, parades, and general frolic. Carnival in Malta can be traced back to the 1400s, and was boosted further by the Knights of St John. Carnival during the time of the Knights consisted of various tournaments and pageants, during which the Knights themselves competed for rewards. Carnival floats became a tradition during Grandmaster Jean Parisot de la Vallette’s rule – yet it was the Knights’ ships which were decorated and displayed in all their glory, and not the land floats.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4130" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/carnival2018.jpg" alt="Carnival2018" width="1379" height="1035" />
"western" >During the time of the Knights another Maltese Carnival tradition was born – the historic ‘Parata’, which is a re-enactment of the 16<sup>th</sup> Century struggle of the Maltese population and the Knights of St John against the rival forces of the Ottoman Turks, who had besieged Malta during their attack in 1565. The ‘Parata’ was taken quite seriously during the time of the Knights, and the Maltese people eagerly awaited the performance. In modern times the ‘Parata’ became less of a dramatic event and more of a commemorative one, with dance troupes performing the traditional dance/battle between the two opposing forces. Carnival in Malta seemed to wane slightly during the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, but continued steadily even under British rule, making it a tradition that spanned more than six centuries, and which is still going strong today.

"western"><b>Present Day</b>
"western" >Nowadays Carnival is a period that entices a section of the population to the extent of dedicating a whole year to its preparation – secretly coming up with ideas for colourful floats and accompanying dance routines, ornate foam costumes and witty mottos. The various Carnival troupes around the island enter their floats in the annual competition, determining which float is the best out of all on the very last night of Carnival. These crews are extremely dedicated to their work, spending most evenings and weekends throughout the year working on next year’s Carnival, having only five short days to enjoy their year’s work. The floats are made out of papier-mach<span lang="mt-MT">e and feature bright, garish colours and various decorative lights. Every float has a specific theme and has an accompanying group of costume-clad dancers to match.</span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4126" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/carnival-dancers.jpg" alt="Carnival Dancers" width="2054" height="1373" />
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">The floats are paraded through the streets of Valletta during the 5 days of Carnival, with the last parade taking place on Mardi Gras, or the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent. The final parade takes place in the evening at St Anne Street, in Floriana. After their final performance, the floats meet an unfortunate end – they are destroyed as preparations for the following Carnival commence. Carnival is a time of year associated with Valletta, where most of the spectacles take place – yet these past few years have seen a resurgence in a different type of Carnival in various towns and villages around Malta; a more spontaneous Carnival, which sometimes even borders on the macabre. Yet no town does spontaneity like Nadur...</span>

"western"><span lang="mt-MT"><b>Gozo Carnival</b></span>
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">The Carnival in Gozo is a totally different experience than its Maltese counterpart. Float parades and dance shows are still held in Victoria, albeit varying slightly from the Maltese. Yet it is in Nadur that the Gozitan Carnival reaches its apex. The Carnival in Nadur is spontaneous, meaning that no committee or governing board imposes its rules upon the festivities. This makes this Carnival an unpredictable one, where characters of all shapes and forms roam the streets; most having a satirical or political undertone to their getup. The Nadur Carnival takes place at night, and the place is</span><span lang="mt-MT"><i> extremely </i></span><span lang="mt-MT">popular – so if you’re planning on visiting, make sure to get there early-ish. Costumes are as unpredictable as the Carnival itself – past years have included people dressed up as politicians, nuns, priests and other religious figures, and even as Jesus Christ himself – a costume which did not go down well with authorities. Grotesque masks always abound, making an easy costume for the lazy reveler. The festivities here continue well into the early morning hours and are definitely less PG-rated than the Valletta or Victoria Carnivals. It is worth a visit though, especially if you happen to be visiting Malta’s sister island during this period.</span>
"western"><span lang="mt-MT"><b>Carnival 2018</b></span>
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">This year’s Carnival will take place between the 8th and the 13th February, starting off at St George’s Square in Valletta. Make sure to grab some Prinjolata (the traditional sweet treat associated with Carnival in Malta) and enjoy the show! Coinciding with the year-long spectacle of V18, Valletta’s tenure as the European Capital of Culture, one can expect great things from this year’s Carnival. Whether you celebrate Carnival in Malta or in Gozo, it is certainly a memorable event not to be missed!</span>

With over 68 years working on Carnival floats, at 87 years of age, Pawlu is still going strong.
Head on to Valletta this Carnival weekend and see what surprises he has in store this year!

            [blog_content] => "western" ><span lang="en-GB">It hasn’t been long since we packed up our Christmas decorations and set our New Year resolutions, yet some of us (actually, </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>all of us, </i></span><span lang="en-GB">I’m sure) are already fantasizing over another holiday. Hot beaches, a smouldering sun, cool dips in the ocean, cocktails, a nightlife that allows you to </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>really </i></span><span lang="en-GB">blow some steam off… Sounds a lot like Malta. </span>
"western"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarqlsEW6F7F14Fq/giphy.gif" />
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">So, you scroll over to your browser and start looking for flights. You find what you want- tickets for Malta. Up until this very moment, it was just a little game in your head, a “</span><span lang="en-GB"><i>haha, what if? No harm in checking”</i></span><span lang="en-GB"> scenario, but then, the inevitable happens. You have a strange, all most out-of-body experience: you lose all control, fingers typing away at the keyboard, as if they have a life of their own. You find yourself inputting your credit card details. A few “ok” and “proceed to billing” clicks. It’s done, there’s no going back now. You’re going to Malta! </span>
"western"><img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MOTkF7sT8u2Z2/giphy.gif" />
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">So tickets are sorted. What’s next? Accommodation!</span>
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">It must be lovely, spacious, with any of the great views that Malta has to offer. There’s only one problem- most hotels that offer just that are fully booked, ridiculously expensive or offer a fantastic view of… a block of concrete.</span>
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">Here at Shortlets Malta, we’d like to persuade you to try out a </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>different </i></span><span lang="en-GB">kind of holiday- why not try renting a holiday apartment? Here are the top four reasons why you should book an apartment with Shortlets today! </span>
"western" ><span lang="en-GB">1. Enjoy the luxuries of building your own timeline for the day: I’ll be the first to admit it- I love buffet breakfasts. Building a scrambled egg mountain, choosing every different type of mini muffin, unlimited cappuccinos... However, something I do dislike (and by dislike I mean </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>loathe with a passion</i></span><span lang="en-GB">) is having to wake up early, or at least, early enough to get to the scrambled eggs and muffins before they run out, or, heaven forbids, turn cold. A self-catering apartment will allow you to wake up as early (or in my case, as late) as you want a build your own scrambled egg mountain, whether it’s at 5 o’clock in the morning (God forbid) or at 1 o’clock in the afternoon. Also, there are no awkward encounters with housekeeping. Independence is a virtue, which you will grow to dearly love!</span>
<img class="aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/StYTkwUST4HUQ/giphy.gif" />
<span lang="en-GB">2. You get to eat the food </span><span lang="en-GB"><i>you </i></span><span lang="en-GB">want: Are you a Gordon Ramsay, or do you just like getting your hands dirty in the kitchen? Do you have any food intolerances or allergies? If you’ve answered yes to the above questions, then a self-catering apartment is probably the best option for you. In Malta, you can find supermarkets or mini-marts at every corner, stocking brands you’re familiar with, or local brands. You can even get fancy and try some local dishes, take an example from this <a href="https://blog.shortletsmalta.com/2018/01/29/recipe-monday-qarabaghli-mimli-il-forn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogpost.</a></span>
  <img style="max-width:100%;" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Zt3tXa86LNlYgE0/giphy.gif" />
<span lang="en-GB">You can make it your home away from home: with more facilities than an average hotel room, you and your family are bound to be more comfortable. No banging on walls, no awkward couple raging next door, no toddlers screaming and crying in the hallway. Not to mention, more privacy for those late night wine and karaoke sessions. Holiday homes are typically tastefully and uniquely decorated (a welcome difference from the one room fits all ideology of a hotel), all the home-y extra touches make it feel like come, a welcome idea after a busy day of sightseeing and a hell of a night dancing in a club.</span>

[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeDD0g5nZYX/?taken-by=shortletsmalta/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<span lang="en-GB">4. One apartment fits all: if you’re a big group of people vacationing together, you won’t have to split up into several rooms by the end of the night. Shortlets Malta will help you find a suitable apartment accommodating your large group so you can share every moment of your holiday together. From dining in  - to watching a movie if the weather is terrible, create new memories and experiences inside and outside the apartment!</span>

            [blog_content] => Kawlata is the kind of soup that originated out of necessity - when people of past times needed to feed as many mouths as possible with as little cost as possible, food had to go a long way. These kinds of soups were invented for this sole purpose, filling empty bellies up with cheap cuts of meat and filling staples so as not to go hungry. Nowadays that food isn't scarce and we have the luxury of choosing what we get to eat every day, we still go for the traditional Kawlata. Why? Because it is a delicious meal, hearty and filling, perfect for warming you up on a bitter cold Winter's day.

Usually served with a side of fries, this dish makes for a perfect Sunday lunch!

            [blog_content] => Kusksu is a delicious Maltese heart-warming soup, traditionally made in the Spring, when broad beans are in season. It is a dish that will transport you back to the Maltese islands, with its mixture of traditional tastes and flavours, especially if you add a Gozitan cheeselet (<em>ġbejna)</em> to your recipe.

            [blog_content] => Proudly perched on a natural plateau, the walled city of Mdina is one of the most beautiful historical locations on the Maltese Islands. Known to many as ‘The Silent City’, Mdina also goes by the names Città Notabile (The Noble City) and Città Vecchia (The Old City) and has been around since roughly the eighth century BC when the Phoenicians settled there and called it ‘Maleth’. Later, around 218 BC, the city fell into the hands of the Roman Republic and became known as ‘Melite’ and actually included a big chunk of the neighbouring town known as Rabat today. As you step through the regal city gate, there’s no doubt that you’ll feel like you’ve just gone back in time, and stepped into a picture-perfect piece of history.
<strong>1. It’s just stunning</strong>
It can be incredibly refreshing to spend the day away from the hustle and bustle of urban life, especially when Mdina is your destination of choice. The Silent City may be relatively small in size (a tactical move which made it easier to defend in the event of a siege), but it’s BIG on typical Maltese charm. We particularly love the way the city looks at night!

<strong>2. The view from the Bastions is breath-taking</strong>
Walk through the main gate and straight across to the imposing bastions - in a matter of minutes, you’ll be treated to a sweeping view of the surrounding towns and rolling fields! Seriously - wow.

<strong>3. St Paul’s Cathedral</strong>
Nestled right in the heart of Mdina, this regal cathedral needed some TLC following the damage it sustained when the earthquake hit Sicily in 1693 (oh, and another one hit it in 1856…). The cathedral was rebuilt according to the designs of prominent Maltese architect, Lorenzo Gafà and headed completion in 1705. If you think the outside is beautiful, just wait until you walk through its doors and get a good look at the inside, which follows the classic Latin cross layout and contains fascinating artefacts dating as far back as the fifteenth century (the cathedral is home to an exquisite baptismal front from the early Renaissance period. After you explore everything the cathedral has to offer, don’t forget to swing by the Cathedral Museum to learn a little more about the structure and see some incredible artworks, artefacts, and even some pieces by Albrecht Dürer!

<strong>4. The National Museum of Natural History</strong>
Located just to your right as you enter the city, the museum is housed in a truly impressive eighteenth-century palazzo built by Grand Master Antonio Manoel de Vilhena according to plans devised by the French architect, Charles François de Mondion. Take some time out of your day and explore the museum’s extensive collection of fossils, minerals, and loads of other curiosities.

<strong>5. Fontanella</strong>
A trip to Mdina isn’t at all complete without a little pit stop at Fontanella, an adorable cafe loved by locals and visitors alike for its perfect location and delicious chocolate cake. No matter what the weather might be like, settling into a spot at this charming spot with a massive slice of cake and a hot cup of tea is absolute bliss.

            [blog_content] => As home to temples other than the great pyramids of Giza themselves, Malta is an absolute goldmine for the history buffs out there. Maltese summers are made for golden tans and lazy days at the beach, but the rest of the year is perfect for <span lang="en-US"><i>really </i></span>digging into our island’s rich, diverse history. From the awe-inspiring megalithic temples, to the Phoenicians, Romans, Normans, Knights of Malta, two world wars and beyond - we’re about to dip into some of the sights you absolutely have to see if you’re living in or even visiting Malta.
<span lang="en-US"><b>1. </b></span><b>Ħ</b><span lang="en-US"><b>agar Qim and Mnajdra</b></span>
Ħagar Qim commands a sweeping view of the sea, with the islet of Filfla clearly in its sights; Mnajdra is just a few minutes away, and both templates are nestled in rugged, Mediterranean countryside. Hagar Qim (c. 3600-3200 BC) means ‘standing stones’ and was first excavated in 1839; the site is made up of a big central building and two smaller structures, following a layout typical of the prehistoric structures found on the Maltese islands. Loads of amazing artefacts were found at the site, including statuettes of human figures, which can be seen at the National Museum of Archaeology. Mnajdra is made up of three temples, with one of them dating as far back as 3600-3200 BC. The site shows extensive use of the dot-pattern used for decorative purposes at other megalithic temples located on the islands.

<span lang="en-US"><b>2. The Hypogeum </b></span>
The Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum is an incredible underground burial site dating back to the Neolithic period (c. 3300-3000 BC). The site was discovered completely by accident during construction work in 1902, and was excavated for the first time by Father Emmanuel Magri, and continued by Sir Themistocles Zammit. Holding the remains of over 7000 humans, the structure is thought to have been used as a burial ground and stands as one of the best and most well-preserved examples of the prehistoric temple-building that produced Hagar Qim, Mnajdra, and the Xaghra Stone Circle.

<span lang="en-US"><b>3. The Grandmaster’s Palace</b></span>
Located in Palace Square right in the heart of Valletta (the 2018 European Capital of Culture), the palace is home to the Office of the President, the House of Representatives, and a fabulous armoury filled with artefacts from the Order of the Knights of St John’s glorious past.

<span lang="en-US"><b>4. St John’s Co-Cathedral</b></span>
An absolute must-see if you’re exploring our stunning capital city, Valletta, St John’s Co-Cathedral is an exquisite example of baroque architecture built by the Order of the Knights of St John between 1573 and 1578. Everywhere you look in this majestic structure you’ll see breath-taking art and precision, from the marble floor populated with angels and skeletons to beautiful paintings across the ceiling and two Caravaggio masterpieces, you’ll be overwhelmed by the Cathedral’s lavish interior.

<span lang="en-US"><b>5. Lascaris War Rooms</b></span>
Perfect if you’re interested in all things World War II, the Lascaris War Rooms are made up of an underground network of rooms that used to serve as the strategic headquarters during the Second World War. This place was of critical importance during the war, serving as the advance Allied HQ and seeing General Eisenhower direct the Invasion of Sicily in 1943.

<span lang="en-US"><b>6. Domvs Romana</b></span>
The Domvs Romana was first discovered in 1881 and is located just between Rabat and the ancient walled city of Mdina. Here, you’ll find a Roman-era aristocratic house in ruins, dating back to around the 1st century BC. Countless well-preserved artefacts were found at the site, including statues, mosaics, tombstones and other remains.

            [blog_content] => "western" >The islands of Malta and Gozo are packed with history, culture and tradition, openly visible around villages and cities. However, there are some hidden gems worth viewing and visiting, but fair warning to you, dear reader- they’re not your typical tourist attractions!
"western"><strong>1. Secret Passage in St. Gregory’s Church</strong>
"western" >This Church, found within the outskirts of Zejtun, is officially known as St. Catherine’s Old Church, however, locals refer to it as St. Gregory’s for the village’s traditional yearly procession. This medieval church was built before 1436, however, its present edifice is a combination of Gothic and Romanesque architecture, dating back to the 16th century, therefore little remains of the original building. It looks like the typical Maltese church, however, a secret U-shaped passage was built within the church, containing a surprising amount of human bones. Legend has it that people were buried alive within these passages during the siege of 1614. Creepy.

"western" align="CENTER"><i>Courtesy of Times of Malta</i>
"western"><strong>2. Mdina Underground Tunnel</strong>
"western" >Fun Fact: The Malta Railway was the only railway ever built on the island, and consisted of a single railway line running from Valletta to Mdina (about 8 miles). Operations started in 1883 but shortly ended in 1931<i> </i>due to high competition from the new bus transport system introduced in Malta. Nowadays the Mdina tunnel that served to operate the railroad was used for mushroom farming but is now totally abandoned. Grab your torches and your Dora the Explorer backpack and get ready for a day of spook and adventure!

"western"><strong>3. Victoria Lines</strong>
"western" >Unofficially (and ironically) referred to as the Great Wall of Malta, the Victoria lines are a line of fortifications that run 12 kilometers across the island, separating the northern and southern regions of Malta. These lines range from Madliena, Mosta, Mgarr, Rabat, and Mdina, and was to serve as a military mechanism to be used by the British military in the 19th century. It is said that the Victoria Lines were built as a consequence to the opening of the Suez Canal. In 1998, the Government of Malta submitted the building to UNESCO for consideration for World Heritage Site status. Go for a walk along the lines on a sunny spring day- the views are endless and magnificent!

"western"><strong>4. Malta Cart Tracks</strong>
"western" >These cart tracks can be found around the Maltese garigue countryside, however, the most popular example of the Cart Tracks would be the Clapham Junction Cart Ruts. These ruts are paired grooves within limestone, thought to have been used for the transportation of carts around the Maltese islands, however, strangely enough, they do not appear to be directly linked to the building of any of Malta’s megaliths. What’s most notable, and rather mysterious, about the Clapham Junction ruts is the fact that these ruts seem to go on underwater. What were they used for? Were they man-made, a geological feature, or were they made by extraterrestrials? The theories are plenty- time to go and form your own!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BaUYb_-gXWH/?tagged=cartruts/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western"><strong>5. Wied il-Ghasri</strong>
"western" >This valley can be found in Gozo, Malta’s sister island. The valley stretches from Ta’ Dbiegi Hill, all the way to Ghasri village, and goes on between Zebbug and Ta’ Gurdan Hill, where the valley narrows down into a stream of seawater, large enough for people to swim in. The stream eventually opens onto the big blue, where divers enjoy exploring surrounding underwater caves. A very interesting cave to spot is one with a shaft dug up towards the top of the cliffs above the bay, which was used to bring seawater to neighbouring saltpans with ropes and buckets. This valley is not only interesting, but aesthetically pleasing, and usually rather abandoned before peak season.

"western"><strong>6. Ahrax tal-Mellieha</strong>
"western" >This area includes a campsite (for the more outdoorsy of us) and also a dive site (for the more adventurous mermaids and mermen). To camp in the area, one needs to obtain a permit from the Mellieha Local Council, but after that, it is as easy as packing a bag and spending a night surrounded by spectacular views and, more notably, shooting stars- a truly different touristic experience. Alternatively, visit the diving site and snorkel around the coral reef and or dive through an underwater entrance to a large cave, yet it is advised to visit the cave with a professional diver. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq8ELSUyNbw">this video</a> for more inspiration.

            [blog_content] => "western" >Short rental properties are terrific – you get a whole home away from home at the price of a hotel room, which is often a fraction of the size of a rental property. While renting a property, you can cook your own meals (thereby saving a substantial amount of cash), wash your clothes (so you won’t need to burden your suitcases with unnecessary clothing) and have a proper place to crash after days of exploring. <a href="http://www.shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Short Lets Malta</a> offers a wide range of rental properties to choose from – from cute 1-bedroom apartments in Sliema that won’t break the bank, to humongous villas in Mellieha which will make you feel like a celebrity. All the properties come fully furnished, readily equipped for a comfortable stay. Yet when living in any rental property for a prolonged period of time – say for two or five months – you might feel the need to make the place more ‘yours’; more personal. We’ve come up with 6 brilliant ways to spruce up your rental without creating any damages to the property, which however will transform your tenantable rental into a cosy home.

<ol>
	<li><strong>Buy fresh flowers and plants</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">This has to be the easiest tip of them all. Find your neighbourhood florist and buy some fresh flowers at the start of each week. The bright hues will liven up your space and lighten up your mood as well! Plants work just as well – they can bring life into lifeless spaces in your rental, such as your bathroom windowsill, or your laundry room. Succulents are easy to care for and come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so you will certainly find one that suits your tastes.

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Fluff up your place with soft furnishings</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">Spending money on soft furnishings may seem like an investment in your rental property; however, it is amazing how different an apartment can look and feel when dressed up with cosy blankets, throws, and cushions. Choose a theme for your rental (or go with the theme set by your landlord) and splurge a little on a comfy blanket and a couple of matching (or mismatching – it’s your call!) cushions. These will do wonders aesthetically while also serving a very useful purpose – keeping you comfortable and warm!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd-W4l_BQEo/?hl=enamp;tagged=cushions/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Rest photo or art frames on shelves or on the floor</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">When renting a property, one of the main rules is always: No Renovations. This means no holes in the walls, no painting, no wallpaper… you get the idea. And it does make sense, as the landlord needs to keep the space as blank a canvas as possible. Still, an artwork is an essential part of each room, and it allows you to express your individuality in your home. The best way to display artwork without breaking the ‘No Renovation’ rule is to rest your artwork on shelves, or on the floor. You might even discover your artistic side and start painting and exhibiting your own pieces!
"western">[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeulUc8hqUE/?hl=enamp;tagged=decor/ hidecaption=true width=720]

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Embrace clip-on lights</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">In a space where you can’t commit to big pieces of furniture, clip-on lights are your friend! Add an extra source of light in your bedroom, or use clip-on lights above your desk for a new feature in your rental home that can easily be moved around and taken with you on check-out. Clip-on lights come in a variety of colours, and can be a quirky but useful prop in any room of your rental home.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BHy66s9hlcR/?hl=enamp;tagged=cliponlight/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Use your pretty luggage as storage!</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">Having nice pieces of luggage is essential when travelling (especially when it comes to recognising your suitcase in a sea of black and blue at the airport!), and it is a shame that these are put away during your stay. Get creative and use your funky luggage as storage in your rental home, giving you extra space to get rid of unsightly clutter while also putting them on display for everyone to see. Sturdy suitcases can also double as end tables when stacked on top of each other, giving your rental an eclectic feel!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BesyaM_Dfk6/?hl=enamp;tagged=suitcase/ hidecaption=true width=720]
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong>Bring a few personal mementos from home</strong></li>
</ol>
"western">If you tend to feel homesick, especially on longer trips, a few knick-knacks from home will make your rental property feel more homely, while also sprucing it up. Personal mementos like photographs are cute reminders of fun times, and other personal items such as your favourite mug will help you feel at home even if you’re miles away. It is also always a good idea to bring your favourite book – it will give you something to read when you’re feeling homesick, and you can use it as part of your décor as well! These small trifles won’t take much space in your suitcase, but they will hold a special place in your heart and they’ll certainly bring some additional comfort to your rental home.

<b>5. St. Patrick’s Day Celebrations, 17</b><b>th</b><b> March in St. Julian’s</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">It’s that time of the year again, ladies and gents! Every March, St. Julian’s (and most of Paceville) transforms into one big, green, beer-focused street party for the day – and that day is St. Patrick’s Day. Now we’re not even a little bit Irish, but the Maltese are always up for a party (and any excuse to drink Guinness and wear funny hats). Top tip: wear comfortable shoes and stay hydrated. Trust us on this one.</span>

            [blog_content] => Whether you’re thinking about visiting Malta for a well-deserved holiday this summer or just want to make this Mediterranean gem your home away from home for a little while, one of the first things you need to think about is where you want to stay. Malta may be a small island (with a very big personality, we might add), but when it comes to finding the right place for you to stay in, there are options to suit every taste, mood and season. Today we’re going to take a little whistle-stop tour of some of our favourite places right here in Malta – which one will you choose?

<strong>Valletta: The 2018 Capital of Culture</strong>

Our majestic capital city is a hotspot for all things cultural, historical and culinary, and home to some of the most incredible baroque architecture you’ll ever see. During the day, Valletta is a bustling centre of business, shopping, and quaint cafes just buzzing with the chatter of friends catching up over coffee or professionals on their lunch breaks. The city is filled with historical attractions to see, including the regal Biblioteka Nazzjonali (National Library), Saint John’s Co-Cathedral, the Lascaris War Rooms, the Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens, and Fort St. Elmo, to name just a few of our personal must-sees. As day fades into a sultry Mediterranean night, the city comes alive once more with countless cozy wine bars, welcoming cocktail lounges and top-quality restaurants for you to savour. Valletta really does have it all.

<strong>Mellieha and St. Paul’s Bay: The Beach Lover’s Haven</strong>

Mellieha and St. Paul’s Bay are two sun-seeker favourites that feel a world away from the hustle and bustle of life in central Malta. Perfect for the beach bunnies out there, you’ll be absolutely spoiled for choice when it comes to choosing which stretch of sandy beach you’ll visit each day, and the crystal blue sea is bound to wash away all your worldly worries the minute you splash into the water. Our favourite spots have to be Ghadira, Little Armier, Paradise Bay, Golden Bay, and Ghajn Tuffieha!

<b>Sliema and Gzira: The Dynamic Duo</b>

<span style="font-weight:400;">These two towns are ideal if you want to be at the heart of all the action and get to know the locals a little better! Sliema and Gzira may be next door neighbors, but they definitely have their own distinct personalities. Sliema is a shopping hotspot dotted with cute cafés and eateries to hit after a long day of retail therapy, while Gzira has that classic Maltese charm and a bit more of a laid-back vibe that Mediterranean people are known for. There are a couple of things these two places have in common: gorgeous seafront views across to the capital city, and a promenade perfect for morning jogs or evening walks! Oh, and as two very central towns, you’ll have great access to transport links here.</span>

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-weight:400;">The Maltese Islands celebrate 14 holidays each year, falling into two categories: Public Holidays and National Holidays. Public Holidays commemorate mostly religious and social themes, while National Holidays recall patriotic themes, namely significant dates in Maltese history which helped change the course of the islands’ fate. National holidays help keep these historical events fresh in our minds, reminding us of the struggles our nation had to undergo to achieve the status it holds today. So, whether you’re new to the islands, or you’ve completely forgotten why we have so many off days throughout the year, we can help you better understand the importance of each National Holiday, and how you can join the celebrations.</span>

<b>31</b><b>st</b><b> March - Freedom Day</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Jum il-Ħelsien, or Freedom Day, is celebrated each 31</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> March, commemorating the same date in 1979 when the British troops and the Royal Navy withdrew their forces from the islands. For the first time in over a thousand years, Malta no longer served as a military station for a foreign power, making the archipelago truly independent, even though by law independence had been given 15 years before. The main events which are held on this day take place on the Freedom Day Monument in Vittoriosa, where wreaths of flowers are placed by Malta’s highest officials, as well as on the War Memorial in Floriana, where a similar ceremony takes place. A Regatta (a traditional Maltese boat race) is held in the afternoon in the Grand Harbour, where seven seaside towns compete for the coveted shield.</span>

<b>7</b><b>th</b><b> June – Sette Giugno</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The 7</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> June in Malta is known by its Italian name, Sette Giugno, and remembers the same day in 1919 when four Maltese patriots were killed by British troops. Following an ever-growing increase in the cost of living after the hardships of World War I, the Maltese started a series of riots and protests against the privileged few – which included the British colonial government - who were keeping the majority in poverty, refusing to raise wages to meet the sensational increase in the prices of everyday supplies. The four Maltese men who were killed during these riots in Valletta were Manwel Attard, Guze Bajada, Lorenzo Dyer and Carmelo Abela. These riots are considered as the first step towards Maltese Independence, a step which took almost fifty years to complete. During this National Holiday, wreaths are placed upon the monument commemorating these four fallen men, which lies in St George’s Square, Valletta.</span>

<b>8</b><b>th</b><b> September – Victory Day </b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September is one of the most important dates in Maltese history. It marks the end of three sieges against the islands, two of which were amongst the bloodiest sieges in history. The Great Siege of 1565 saw its end on the 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September, when Ottoman Troops retired in defeat after more than three months of Siege against the islands. The Siege of Valletta of 1800 marked the end of the French occupation of Malta, also on the 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September. The Siege of Malta during World War II also saw its end on this fateful day, when the Italian army withdrew their attacks in 1943, thus marking the end of World War II in the Maltese Islands. This momentous date also marks the feast of the birth of the Virgin Mary, a venerated feast on the Maltese Islands, celebrated as the village feast in Senglea, Naxxar, Mellieħa, and Xagħra, Gozo.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">The 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September nowadays is mostly known for the traditional Regatta, held in the Grand Harbour. The towns of Cospicua, Vittoriosa, Senglea, Birzebbuga, Marsa, Valletta and Kalkara compete for the laudable shield, each hoping that their town’s name will be engraved as that year’s winner. The Armed Forces of Malta commemorate this day with an annual Parade along Republic Street in Valletta, a procession which ends at St John’s Co-Cathedral, in the presence of Malta’s highest officials.</span>

<b>21</b><b>st</b><b> September – Independence Day</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Independence Day, or Jum l-Indipedenza as it is known in Maltese, commemorates the 21</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September 1964, when Malta gained Independence from the British. The British government had promised the Maltese their independence as a reward for the hardships the islands had to endure during the Second World War. Nearly twenty years after the end of the war, Malta finally became Independent, with the Maltese flag finally raised at the Independence Arena in Floriana on the night between the 20</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> and 21</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> September 1964, among the cheer and delight of the Maltese population. Gorg Borg Olivier was elected first Prime Minister of the newly Independent Maltese Islands, inaugurating the festivities which were held on the day. Nowadays this historic day is commemorated by the placing of wreaths on the Independence Monument in Floriana. </span>
<b>13</b><b>th</b><b> December – Republic Day</b>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The 13</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> December of 1974 marks the date when the Maltese constitution was amended to remove the British Monarch as the head of the Maltese state, with its sovereignty being held by its own President. Sir Anthony Mamo was named Malta’s first President of the Republic, thus heralding an end to Queen Elizabeth II’s rule over the archipelago, a role that was still held despite Malta’s Independence ten years prior. This day is still remembered by various activities, mainly by the awarding of Ġieħ ir-Repubblika by the President of the Maltese Islands to citizens who deserve this highest honour. Wreaths are also placed upon the Republic Day Monument in Marsa, and a military parade is held in the main streets of Valletta. </span>

            [blog_content] => <span lang="en-US">When you work hard, you deserve to play even harder - that’s why we do things like book holidays, treat ourselves to a bit of shopping, buy a new car, enjoy fancy dinners or cheeky days at the spa, isn’t it? If you’re visiting Malta this summer, rest and sun-soaked relaxation are the absolute order of the day </span><span lang="en-US"><b>every day </b></span><span lang="en-US">- no matter how long (or indeed short) your Mediterranean break might be. With a well-planned visit to this piece of Mediterranean heaven, you can bet that all your worldly worries will wash away like a single shell carried off by the gentle tides that kiss our sandy shores. To take that well-deserved self-indulgence to the next fabulous level, stay in a luxury villa! We know you probably don’t need much persuading about this bit, but </span><span lang="en-US"><i>just in case</i></span><span lang="en-US"> here are a few reasons to <a href="https://www.luxuryvillasmalta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rent a villa during your stay in Malta</a><!--  http://shortletsmalta.com/villas.html -->.</span>
<b>1. It’s cost-effective</b>
<span lang="en-US">Just because you’re treating yourself to this kind of luxury, it doesn’t mean you’ll have to break the bank! Villas can actually end up being far more cost-effective than staying at a hotel; get together with your nearest and dearest and watch the per-night price drop and drop again. You know what that means? A bigger cocktail budget. That’s what we like to see.</span>

<b>2. Feel right at home (away from home)</b>

<b>3. Perfect poolside spots</b>

"western" >If, like fine wines, you prefer the more sophisticated side of life, then this stunning apartment is the ideal abode for your Malta travels. Located in the European Capital of Culture 2018, in the gorgeous Valletta - which in itself is an open-air museum - this beautiful apartment is modernly decorated and consists of all the amenities you might need on your Malta holiday. With a magnificent sea view balconies overlooking the historic Grand Harbour, and situated above Valletta's old entrance - Victoria Gate - you'll feel right at home sipping fine Maltese wine and enjoying this eternal city.

"western" >If you're in Malta on business, chances are you'd rather reside in the business district of the island - Sliema or St Julian’s. This 4-bedroom apartment in Sliema is at the heart of its business centre, while also enjoying a breath-taking view over the harbour towards Valletta. While life in Sliema resembles city life with its bustling businesses, its rush hour traffic and its many residents rushing to and fro, by night this town is transformed into an entertainment hub, with a myriad of bars opening their doors for after-work drinks, going on until the wee hours of the morning. This apartment is just the ticket - being close enough to Sliema centre that you can walk to any meeting, while also being far enough from the bars so that you can enjoy a good night's sleep. You truly get the best of both worlds, and while you're here on business, it would be a shame to just enjoy the business side of the town!

            [blog_content] => "western" ><span style="font-size:large;">When one thinks of Gozo, Malta’s untainted sister island, one might quickly jump to thoughts of a villa or a farmhouse in the middle of a tranquil village, lounging by a pool, a trip to Maxokk (Gozo’s most sought after bakery, home of the Gozitan ftira) or Jessica’s Delights (a local cake shop found in Marsalforn)- basically, all things that spell R-E-L-A-X. And admittedly, for the purposes of relaxing, Gozo is definitely your one-stop shop. </span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;">However, what can this island offer for the more adventurous, free-spirited of us? Those who crave an adrenaline rush over a lazy nap in the sun? Don’t fret- Shortlets Malta has got you covered! From fun, to almost crazy, for amateurs to experts, these are the top 6 activities to try out in Gozo.</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>1. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-jeep-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gozo Jeep Tour</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">Forget the typical “Hop-On-Hop-Off” tourist bus, when you’re in Gozo, you want to feel every dent in the ground, every cool breeze on a hot summer’s day. Get your Gozo adventure started with an all-day Jeep Tour around Gozo, to discover the most beautifully hidden local gems, such as Qala, Belvedere, Ramla l-Hamra (Ramla Bay), Calypso’s Cave, the Salt Pans, Xlendi and many more. We wouldn’t normally say this but...get your selfie stick and go nuts!</span>

"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>2. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-quad-bike-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rent a Quad Bike</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">Another way how to spice up your Gozo tour- rent a Quad Bike and follow your tour leader to Gozo’s most remote areas, like Ghasri Valley, Dwejra, Kercem Heights, Simar Valley and many more, whilst enjoying the thrill that nothing but a quad bike can give you. A “swim stop”, i.e. an occasion to stop by a bay for a quick dip in the sea, is also offered during the summer season. Grab a quad bike buddy and start your engines!</span>

"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>3. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/sup-in-gozo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUP in Gozo</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">What’s Sup? (Get it? Yeah, me neither). SUP stands for Stand Up Paddleboarding, which is basically an excuse to fall into the water repeatedly during those hot summer days. Or not! Whether you want to take this water sport seriously, or make some great memories with family and friends, SUP is the way to go. Take the opportunity to soak in the views; from Ghasri to Dahlet Qorrot, sometimes ranging all the way to Comino, this sport/tour combination can take you places. A giant SUP is also available (can fit 5-8 people)! Bonus: you can even SUP at night! We did warn you that we can be adventurous.</span>

"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>4. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/kayaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kayaking in Gozo</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">Not only is the word “kayaking” fun to say (repeat it out loud ten times and you’ll get on my wavelength) but it is also fun to do! With so many beautiful bays in Gozo offering the most spectacular views, why not spend a day kayaking with an experienced guide/ instructor? Suitable for any level or expertise, this activity can take you around the shorelines of Gozo, or even to Comino and back. Get ready to get soaked!</span>

"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>5. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/helicopter-tours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take a Helicopter Tour</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">It’s time to get your feet off the ground and soar high up in the sky, to see Gozo like you’ve never seen it before. Fly on the Robinson 44 and listen to the audio guide whilst you soar above the three islands- Malta, Gozo, and Comino- the 3-in-1 package you’ve been waiting for. Bonus: no need to bring your camera, or waste precious moments fiddling with your phone to grab the best photo- a video of the flight may also be taken upon request! Bon Voyage!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:large;"><b>6. <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/scuba-diving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Scuba Diving</a>: </b></span><span style="font-size:large;">There’s no better way to experience Gozo: some say that the most beautiful scenery belonging to the Maltese Islands is found underwater! Whether you are certified or wanting to experience something new, this is THE occasion to explore Malta’s history like never before. Visit wrecks, reefs and underwater caves, and capture the beauty of Mediterranean marine life. The bays are safe, and sheltered- perfect for beginners and interesting for experts alike.</span>

"western"><u></u><strong>What is </strong>Isle<strong> of MTV?</strong>
"western" >Isle of MTV is Malta’s number one annual summer music festival organised by MTV Europe itself, where well-renowned music artists perform in front of thousands of people from all around the world. Before establishing itself in Malta in 2007, this festival was held in Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy. Therefore, this year will mark the 11th anniversary of Malta’s biggest open-air festival in its history! Big names that have participated in the Isle of MTV festival in the past include Maroon 5, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Will.I.Am, Wiz Khalifa, and DNCE. So, who’s coming this year (apart from you, of course)?

"western"><strong>First Act for Isle of MTV 2018- Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike</strong>
"western" >Dimitri Thivaios and Michael Thivaios are the Greek/Belgian masterminds behind this chart-topping DJ Duo, ranking number 1 and number 2 consecutively in 2014, 2015, 2016 and again in 2017 on the Top 100 DJs List. They quickly rose to fame when they hosted Tomorrowland for the first time, and were given the go-ahead to make the anthem of the Tomorrowland Festival, “Tomorrow (Give in to the Night)”, featuring Dada Life and Tara McDonald.

Following that milestone, the duo went on to create other yearly anthems, such as “The Way we see the World” and “Tomorrow changed Today”, but their biggest hit was surely their 2014 single “Tremor”, featuring Martin Garrix. In 2015, their single “The Hum”, in collaboration with Ummet Ozcan, saw them reaching for the number 1 spot in Belgian singles charts, and winning them “Best Global Dj”, “Best Big Room DJ”, “Best Music Video” and earning them a Platinum record in their country.

            [blog_content] => Malta's historic sites surely know how to pack a punch. They're ancient, they're beautiful, and some of them are downright spooky... Spooky, you might think? Yes, some of Malta's historical sites have some bloody backgrounds, some gory, gruesome details that are sometimes left out of the history books. Some of these spectral stories are based on popular legends, while some are proven to be true. Nevertheless, it is still fun to know some additional details about a historical site you're visiting, and you can amuse your friends with your new found knowledge about the sites. Ready to delve into the macabre mysteries that surround Malta's historical sites?
<strong>1. Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4239" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/hypogeum-2.png" alt="hypogeum 2" width="800" height="331" />
The Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni is a spine-tingling place to visit. Located underground (from the Greek hypo - meaning under, and geum - meaning earth), this shrine was discovered by accident: workers stumbled upon it while digging a well. A series of subterranean chambers was unearthed, winding down into the bowels of the earth. These stone carved rooms are as mind-boggling as they are impressive, and it remains a mystery as to how these primitive peoples could construct such an intricate structure underground. Yet the mystery continues to unravel. During a school trip to the Hypogeum in 1938 by a fourth-year class and their teacher, the whole class vanished. Having scrambled down to the third level of the temple (a level which is now closed to the public), these children and their teacher lost their way back, and never saw the light of day again. The people of the area swore they could hear children screaming for up to four days after their disappearance, yet these poor pupils were never found. This incident was reported in the National Geographic of 1940, and while the Maltese authorities try to dispel the above occurrence as a "myth" designed to "keep children out of these underground places", the truth may very well never be known.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4240" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/hypogeum.png" alt="hypogeum" width="1067" height="800" />
<strong>2. St Paul's Catacombs</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4245" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/st-pauls-catacombs-2.png" alt="st pauls catacombs 2" width="690" height="365" />
During Roman rule in Malta, burials inside the city walls were prohibited. Early Christianity was on the rise, especially after St Paul's visit, and these early Christians needed a place to bury their dead since Christianity dictated that the body would be resurrected just like the body of Christ at the end of times. Since they could not bury their dead in the Medina, they moved just outside the city walls and into the suburb of Rabat, where they constructed the earliest Christian tombs on the islands. These tombs were practically small interconnected hypogea, which spread, web-like underneath Rabat. What is creepy about these catacombs are the main halls, decorated with a large, circular and low-lying table; much like the tables, Roman homes used for dining. These early Christians used to gather here, near their dead, to pray and break bread, honouring their dead loved ones in commemorative rituals. These catacombs housed tombs for over 1000 people, making them the largest tombs of their kind on the island.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4244" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/st-pauls-catacombs-1.png" alt="st pauls catacombs 1" width="800" height="600" />
<strong>3. Mdina Dungeons</strong>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-4242 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mdina-dungeons-1.png" alt="mdina dungeons 1" width="621" height="464" />
The dungeons beyond the ground level of the Magisterial Palace in Mdina are now notoriously known as the 'Mdina Dungeons', Malta's only dark walk attraction. The dungeons now portray different aspects of the horrors of Maltese life of the past - from the Roman era, when Malta was probably used as a slave colony, to the heavy hand rule during the time of the Knights of St John. The Romans were famously inhuman in their punishments, from beheadings to crucifixions; these were not people to be messed with! Fast-forward to the time of the Order of St John, punishments were still as harsh as ever, with the culmination being the establishment of the Inquisitor's office, whose aim was of suppressing heresy against the Catholic Church. This was done through a series of torture methods - but more on that below. The dungeons portray all the creative and imaginative ways that punishment was inflicted throughout Malta's history. While certainly not for the faint of heart, this attraction is an insight into the gore and gruesomeness that once dominated everyday life on the islands. It sure makes us glad to be alive during a time when all these atrocities have been abolished!
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4243" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mdina-dungeons-2.png" alt="mdina dungeons 2" width="1024" height="768" />
"western" ><strong>4. Inquisitor's Palace</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4246" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/inquisitor-2.png" alt="inquisitor 2" width="828" height="550" />
When you mention torture and punishment in Malta, the Inquisitor's Palace in Birgu comes to mind. After more than 500 years of its establishment, this imposing palace still manages to instill fear into the Maltese minds - exactly as it was meant to do all those years ago. The office of the Inquisitor was founded in Malta to put an end to heresy against the church, and this meant anything from witchcraft to blasphemy. The Palace excelled in extremely creative forms of corporal punishment - from the notorious 'bir tas-skieken' (well of knives - ouch!) to the 'stringitore', a wooden device which used to crush a victim's ankles. These methods of torture were mostly implemented during trials, at the sight of which most people pleaded guilty straight away. Some of the torture devices were pure figments of the Maltese imagination, and only two persons are known to have been killed at the palace - both of whom were burned alive (still ouch!). The aim of the Office of the Inquisitor was definitely met, as the mere mention of the place still manages to send shivers down the Maltese people's spines.

Ġbejna (Maltese pronunciation: [ˈd͡ʒbɛjnɐ], plural ġbejniet) are cheeselets typically made from sheep milk, salt, and rennet. They are prepared and served in a variety of forms: pickled, salted, peppered, covered in herbs, dried, or as a plain, fresh cheeselet. Trying a fresh Maltese ġbejna when visiting Malt is definitely a must!

            [blog_content] => Malta’s coastline is dotted with over 30 coastal watchtowers… and you definitely cannot miss them! These beautiful towers are rich in history and are also great marking spots for beautiful walks around Malta’s amazing coastline.

[wpvideo qBE6AYTW]

Towers were built by the Knights of Malta and date back to the 17th century. Different features distinguish towers built by different Grand Masters. Location was strategically chosen so that each tower could view neighbouring towers. A firing signal was given from one tower to the next when enemies approached quickly alerting the whole Island.

            [blog_content] => Corned Beef was a war-time food staple that people ate out of necessity. Yet it remained a favourite among people of all ages long after the war had ended. Part influenced by the colonial rule of the British, and part out of their sheer love of good food, the Maltese took on corned beef pie as a traditional dish, one which is still enjoyed in many a Maltese home to this day (although we can't quite grasp why corned beef is mostly known as <em>bulu beef</em> among the Maltese!)

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

2 large tins corned beef
1 small can tomato paste [about 120g]
4 large carrots, finely diced
1 large onion finely diced
8 very small potatoes, cooked and cut into 4 pieces
1 packet ready-made short crust pastry [500g]
3 tbsp vegetable oil
A little water

<strong>Method</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Heat the oil and add the carrots and onion and cook until carrots are soft. If necessary add a little water.</li>
	<li>Preheat the oven at 180°C.</li>
	<li>In the meantime cook the potatoes, do not cook them too much, you can boil, microwave or steam them. Cut them in 4 and set aside.</li>
	<li>When carrots amp; onion are cooked, add the corned beef and tomato paste. Give it a good stir and simmer for a couple of minutes until the corned beef smashes down.</li>
	<li>Stir well again and turn off the heat. Mash the potatoes and stir them in. Set the mixture aside.</li>
	<li>Roll out the pastry and put it onto an oiled/buttered 28cm round pie dish and prick the base with a fork.</li>
	<li>Add the corned beef mixture and cover with the remainder of the pastry. Prick the top as well so excessive steam comes out of the pie.</li>
	<li>Cook in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until pastry is golden.</li>
</ul>

            [blog_content] => Tarja Froġa is a Maltese pasta omelet, traditionally made with vermicelli. This dish was an ingenious way of bulking up freshly cooked pasta or turning leftovers into a second meal, as it comes together without much effort, but disappears just as fast!

<img class=" size-full wp-image-4026 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/tarja-froga-2.jpg" alt="tarja froga 2.jpg" width="684" height="1024" />

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

300grms Vermicelli Spaghetti
3 beaten eggs
5tbs grated cheese
seasoning (salt and pepper)
Olive Oil

<strong>Method</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Beat the eggs into a big bowl, add the cheese and seasoning</li>
	<li>Mix the cooked vermicelli</li>
	<li>Put a little olive oil in a frying pan, and spread the contents of the bowl in it.</li>
	<li>Fry on a low heat till its golden brown and crispy on both sides.</li>
	<li>Serve piping hot!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tip!</strong> - Be careful when turning over the froġa, if it's not cooked enough it will end up breaking up while turning. You can use a plate to help you flip it over.

"western" >In an age when social media and gadgets dominate every sector of life, it’s difficult to put down your phone, and consequently, shut off your brain. Truthfully, at Shortlets Malta, we highly encourage your selfie-ing and facebook-ing (I mean, we love social media too!), however, we also encourage a well-deserved scrolling break for your thumb, from time to time.

"western" >Gone are the days when “me time” meant reading for hours on end, breathing in the scent of the old yellow sheets of paper, crying over the death of our favourite hero. Instead, “me time” became scrolling through Instagram, wonder what Kylie Jenner is up to next, and crying over the death of our favourite Game of Thrones character.

"western" >So here we are, trying to combine our many loves - our love of Malta, our love of travelling, our love of relaxing, and our love for books. These are the top 5 books about Malta, that you have to read before, during and after your stay in Malta (especially for when the after-holiday blues hit!):
"western" ><b>1. In the Name of The Prince: Maltese Corsairs 1760-1798, by Liam Gauci: </b>Gauci’s book narrates the tales and trials of the Corsairs, who were, in fact, not pirates, but worked within a completely legal framework to plunder and pillage goods, gold, and rum belonging to neighbouring lands, including Malta. This was done via an increasingly sought after the letter of marque issued in the name of the Prince and the Grand Master of Malta. Immerse yourself in the world of the Maltese Corsair, and read all about this forgotten legacy.

"western"  align="CENTER"><b>2. Two, by Teodor Reljic: </b>Elizabeth, on her annual Malta holiday, suffers a heart attack and slips into a deep coma, to her family’s dismay. With no hope of recovery, her son William is desperate- surrounded by the grief and despair of his family members. Yet William’s mother left him something vital, hidden deep within his childhood; stories about a young boy named Vermillion, who lived between two hills in a distant land (sounds familiar?). A stranger appears in his life, a stranger who knows more about Elizabeth than any stranger should. Could he be the one to give William the answers he is looking for?

"western"  align="CENTER"><b>3. The Kappillan of Malta, by Nicholas Monsarrat: </b>Set in World War II Malta, this is the riveting tale of Father Salvatore, a priest who had vowed to take care of the poor of the island. He tends to the ones left homeless, frightened, hungry and vulnerable by the war, whilst wrestling with his personal inner conflicts. Get familiar with Malta’s history through this enchanting book, you might even end up being your own tour guide!

"western"  align="CENTER"><b>4. Il Colore del Sole, by Andrea Camilleri: </b>this one is for our Italian fans; whoever is familiar with Andrea Camilleri’s works is probably also familiar with our favourite Inspector Montalbano. Yet in this particular novel, Camilleri is our hero. During his travels in Siracusa, our author, not being able to resist a mystery, finds himself in possession of old, jumbled up notes, presumably forming part of a diary kept by Caravaggio himself during his time in Sicily and Malta. Beautifully written, as always; this book is a must-read!

"western" align="CENTER"><i>Courtesy of www.naufragio.it</i>
"western"  align="CENTER"><b>5. The Information Officer, by Mark Mills: </b>Another spectacular read for those enchanted by Malta’s trials during World War II, Mills’ novel is set in 1942 when aerial bombardment was rife and relations between the British Empire and the island were spreading thin. The murder of a local girl spurs our hero, Max Chadwick, to look into what really happened, whilst struggling to keep the locals’ (and his) moral high. This novel is laden with information about Malta during the war, yet it thrives as an enthralling novel with deeply complex characters.

"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Going on holiday can be a stressful event, which is ironic – since holidays are meant to be a relaxing experience. Yet with all the packing, flights, accommodation, sight-seeing… a holiday can feel like tons of work. We gathered some travelling tips and tricks to make your journey, arrival and stay a pleasant and smooth-sailing experience, not one you’d need another vacation to recover from!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #1 Book a rental property for your vacation</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4297" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt2.jpg" alt="tt2" width="797" height="532" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Let’s face it, hotels are ridiculously overpriced, and you’re generally stuck in a bland, square, cookie-cutter room that’s far less impressive than the photos you saw online. When you’re travelling for a long stretch of time, a hotel room can seem suffocating and very limiting. Booking a rental property on the other hand, gives you plenty of space (especially great if you’re on a family holiday and have kids tagging along), and gives you the freedom only a home can give: you can cook, you can wash your clothes, you can invite your newly made friends over without it being too cramped… you’re basically renting a home away from home, and at a much cheaper price than a hotel room too!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #2 Leave your guidebooks at home</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4296" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt3.jpg" alt="tt3" width="1379" height="488" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">While we do suggest that you do some reading about the location you’ll be visiting, we strongly recommend leaving your guidebook behind and just winging it. Chances are, the locals will be more than happy to help you find your way around, and they might even show you some really cool aspects of the location you’re visiting – aspects you won’t find in guidebooks. Whether it’s the best place to get cocktails on happy hour, or the best location to view the sunset – locals do know best. So let your adventurous side take over and ditch the guides. </span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #3 Pack less</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4295" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt4.jpg" alt="tt4" width="1379" height="920" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">This is particularly helpful if you’re following tip #1. Staying in a vacation rental provides you with your very own washing machine, a very handy tool to use when you want to avoid those nasty overweight fees at the airport. Pack the basics, and pack less than you think you need. You’ll travel lighter (no grunting while hauling your luggage onto the overhead compartment), and you’ll have more space for knickknacks and souvenirs! Also, make sure to roll your clothes rather than fold them, rolling takes much less space. And make good use of your items; for example, even though shoes are a bulky item to pack, they’re hollow! The inside of your shoe is a great place to tuck away your bits and bobs without any fear of damage or tangling!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #4 Eat like a local</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4294" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt5.jpg" alt="tt5" width="1379" height="925" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Sure you’ll get bombarded with restaurants as soon as you hit a famous landmark, but do you really want to eat where the tourists eat? Chances are the food will be tasteless and frustratingly overpriced, making you feel like you’ve been ripped off and generally ruining your holiday vibe. Stroll a few blocks down, mingle with the local scene (see Tip #2) and run a Tripadvisor search on the restaurants which catch your eye. Also, don’t forget to check out your corner grocery shop or fruit stall, for some quick and easy go-to snacks which you will desperately need after hours of sightseeing. Looking for an extra challenge? Try to learn the names of fruits and vegetables in the local language and impress the shop staff with your newly acquired knowledge!</span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #5 Find free WIFI hotspots</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4293" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt6.jpg" alt="tt6" width="1379" height="920" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">Data roaming charges can truly skyrocket your expenses while on holiday (depending where you’re visiting), so make use of every free WIFI hotspot you encounter. Don’t be shy of asking restaurant and bar staff for the WIFI password either – they will be happy to oblige. Holiday rental properties generally come with free WIFI included too, meaning you can plan your itinerary for the day on Google Maps before you actually start your day. Make sure to download maps for offline use too – just say ok Google when you’ve found your route. It’ll be much easier navigating through an unknown street with easy access to your map. </span>
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>Tip #6 Use your accommodation TV as a phone charger</b></span>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4292" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tt7.jpg" alt="tt7" width="1379" height="913" />
"western" ><span style="font-size:medium;">There is NOTHING worse than having your phone battery die on you – and that is a hundred times worse if you’re stuck with a dead battery while abroad. If you and your significant other are battling it out on who gets to charge their phone on the one charger you’ve brought with you – outsmart them. Bring a USB cable and plug your phone to the TV! Most LCD TVs come with a USB port at the back, making the TV an ideal charging station for your phone without having to figure out if your plug fits the local sockets. Charge your phone during the night for full battery potential on your sightseeing, and wave goodbye to that dreaded 0% battery!</span>

Look no further! <a href="http://www.shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Short Lets Malta</a>   have tons of options for you to choose from – and they all come with their very own washing machine!

            [blog_content] => "western" >Malta is a history lover's paradise. This island has attracted a variety of ancient populations, each of whom left their mark on its stones. While some of these remains are quite known to the public and are visited regularly by tourists and locals, there are other sites which seem to lie low on travellers' radars. Yet these historical locations are still significant and are perfect to visit if you’re in Malta for a longer period of time. Today, we delve into four lesser known sites to explore their unique features and the impact they left on the island.

<b>Skorba Temple</b>
"western" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4303" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/skorba-temple.jpg" alt="Skorba Temple" width="1200" height="787" />The temple at Skorba is one of the smallest temple structures found in Malta. This ancient site is located in Zebbiegh, limits of Mgarr, amidst a sea of fields and rolling hills. The landscape here has not changed much from how it was at the time of the temple builders and gives us a better perspective of what the temple builders actually saw and experienced during their time. The earliest remains found in this structure date back to over 4000 B.C., meaning that this area had been inhabited very early on in our island's history.  What remains of the temple are mostly upright stones known as megaliths, as well as foundation stones which show us how the temple might have looked like. The remains found at this site were of unique importance to archaeologists, with the most recognisable being a terracotta figure of the mother goddess, which can now be found at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta.

Visiting Hours: Monday to Sunday: 09.00 - 17.00hrs
Last admission at 16.30hrs
Closed on 24, 25 amp; 31 December, 1 January amp; Good Friday
Due to the small size and fragility of these sites, only 15 visitors may be admitted at a time
"western" ><b>Ta' Hagrat Temple</b>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-4305 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ta-hagrat-temple.jpg" alt="Ta Hagrat Temple" width="500" height="350" />
The temple at Ta' Hagrat can also be found in the same area as Skorba, in the small village of Mgarr. Ta' Hagrat is also on the smaller side, yet it is a beautifully preserved temple which still retains much of its original structure. This temple is easily recognisable due to its monumental doorway, which was reconstructed in 1937 using its original lintel. The doorway is instantly distinguishable as it includes a three-step entryway, a feature which is rarely seen in other temple sites. Both Ta' Hagrat and Skorba temples are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, due to their ancient age and historical significance. These temples are some of the lesser known among Malta’s vast network of ancient sites; however, they are worth a visit to truly appreciate their beauty.

Visiting hours: Monday to Sunday: 09.00 - 17.00hrs

<b>Ta’ Bistra Catacombs</b>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4304" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ta-bistra-catacombs.jpg" alt="Ta' Bistra Catacombs" width="709" height="487" />
Ta' Bistra Catacombs, located in the town of Mosta, are the largest network of underground tombs outside of the Mdina/Rabat area found in Malta so far. These catacombs date back to the 4th Century AD, when Malta was slowly being converted to Christianity. Marvelously preserved, these catacombs are now one of the most accessible sites in Malta, with ramps allowing for wheelchair and pushchair access, as well as an interactive visitor's centre with audio-visual information about the tombs. While certainly not as known as the catacombs in Rabat, this newly refurbished heritage site shines a new light on life (and death) during the early stages of Christianity on the island.

Visiting hours: Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturdays between 09.00 and 17.00hrs
Last admission is at 16.30hrs
Closed on 24, 25 amp; 31 December, 1 January amp; Good Friday
"western" ><b>Fort Rinella</b>
"western" ><img class=" size-full wp-image-4301 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fort-rinella.jpg" alt="Fort Rinella" width="582" height="389" />
The Rinella Battery in Kalkara dates back to the Victorian era, when Malta was under British rule. This site was never used as a fort during its time, yet the name Fort Rinella stuck. In this site, one can find one of the two surviving Armstrong 100-ton guns - a mammoth weapon which is bewildering to behold even today. Rinella was one of two batteries containing such guns - the other gun which used to be at Cambridge battery near Tigne Point has been lost. This site is worth a visit for its historical re-enactments by Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna, where actors dressed as 19th Century British soldiers provide regular tours as well as reconstructions of battles of the era using weapons of that period. There is also a fantastic audio-visual experience and visitors can also get a chance to be part of the re-enactment itself. Fancy firing a Victorian rifle, anyone?

Visiting hours: Fort Rinella is open Mon - Sat from 10.00 till 17.00hrs.
Closed<b> </b>on New Year's Eve, New Year, Good Friday, Easter, Santa Marija 15 August, Christmas Eve and Christmas.

            [blog_content] => "western" >Before visiting Malta, you will undoubtedly have done some research – places to visit, historical sites to see and so forth. In your search you will have come across a massive but quite plain looking church, located in the middle of Valletta, the European City of Culture 2018. St John’s Co-Cathedral should definitely be on your ‘must-see’ list, even if churches aren’t usually on your holiday itinerary. This is not your regular, run of the mill church: this Co-Cathedral is a spectacular example of Baroque art, in all its pompous glory.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfG-K3YA9Qe/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western">Getting there
"western" >Valletta is Malta’s best connected city, with almost all buses on the island ending their trip there. Finding a bus to Valletta is easy – check out the bus stops in your area, and find the ones which have Valletta as their destination (quick tip, if you can’t manage to find it on one side of the street, try the other side!) If you’re living in Sliema, you can also get a ferry to Valletta, which also gives you a lovely little tour around the Harbour. Driving to Valletta can be a bit tricky, as parking within the city can be difficult, not to mention expensive. If you’re renting a car, you can park at the car park in Floriana, giving you easy access to the city while ensuring that your car is parked safely. As soon as you reach City Gate, reaching the Co-Cathedral is easy. Walk down Republic Street until you reach a crossroads, with a green kiosk selling flowers on your right. Turn right at this kiosk, and you’ll be able to behold the imposing structure of the church before you. It is essential to take a look at the Co-Cathedral before entering, as you’ll see a stark contrast from the outside to the inside.

"western" >In order to reach the visitor’s entrance, head back to Republic Street, walk slightly further up, and you’ll see the law court (huge Greek temple-style building) on your left. The visitor’s entrance will be on your right!

"western">The Interior
"western" >Upon entering, your eyes will need to adjust to the sheer number of embellishments found in the entrails of this church. There is something to see everywhere you look: from the marble tombs which cover the floor, to the gilded carvings of flowers, plants and angels on all the walls, to the marvellous fresco ceiling. The Co-Cathedral is dedicated to St John the Baptist, who was the patron saint of the Order of St John. Built in 1577 following the design of the famed Maltese architect Glormu Cassar, it was originally simply decorated, matching its exterior much more than it does today. The exterior was constructed to look like a fortress, plain and sturdy, withstanding attacks. During the seventeenth century, when the flamboyant Baroque style came to fashion, Grand Master Cotoner ordered a complete redecoration of the interior. He commissioned the renowned Italian artist Mattia Preti, who transformed the Co-Cathedral into the masterpiece we can still witness to this day.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgbpSfrA91p/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Preti revamped the vaulted ceiling, and used it as a canvas for his depiction of the life of St John the Baptist, using illusionary effects which gave the impression that the ceiling was much more elaborate than it actually was. With his skilful use of colour, Preti created a masterpiece of illusionistic effects. The carvings on the walls were also perpetrated by this Calabrian artist, transforming what was once bare stone into a cornucopia of golden flowers and plants. The side chapels of the Cathedral were designated to the different languages of the Order, much like they each had their own auberge. These chapels are also lavishly decorated, and some contain some of the most impressive funereal memorials to the Grand Masters, most of which were done by Mattia Preti himself. One of the most impressive of these monuments is, befittingly, the monument to Grand Master Cotoner, which encapsulates his chivalry and military prowess in marble. This memorial can be found in the chapel of Aragon, on the opposite side of the visitor’s entrance.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BdkDYEkA6iF/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Also worth noticing is the copiousness of tombstones on the floor of this artistic masterpiece. Inlaid with Latin inscriptions and a variety of symbols, these marble tombs are a unique feature of this Co-Cathedral, telling each Knight’s story in a distinctive way.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf8XGG4jCL-/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >The sanctuary, being the focal point of the church, is also elaborately decorated, and features a stunning sculpture depicting the baptism of Christ, by the Italian sculptor Giuseppe Mazzoli. The white marble statues depicting Jesus Christ and his cousin are worked in the traditional Baroque style, giving movement to the sculpture. The central nave can now also be viewed from above, thanks to the restoration of the balcony which lies above the main door. This impressive gallery was restored recently, and is now open to the public.
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgyD1JHHl-k/?hl=enamp;taken-at=338413193/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Last but not least, in the Oratory which is located to the right of the main door, lie the magnificent paintings by Caravaggio. Michelangelo Merisi, better known as Caravaggio, graced the church with two paintings: one depicting Saint Jerome, and the altar piece showing the beheading of St John the Baptist. Both paintings display the artist’s expert use of the chiaroscuro effect as well as his harsh realism, and are both masterpieces in their own right. The painting portraying the beheading is the largest painting attributed to the artist, and the only one known to be signed. Caravaggio’s signature can be spotted underneath the pool of blood forming under the Saint’s head. This work of genius by itself is worth a visit to this Cathedral.

            [blog_content] => "western" >The magical thing about living in Malta is that history is always just around the corner. Whether you’re strolling down the streets of Valletta, wandering around Mdina, or marvelling at some of the oldest man-made structures in the world, history surrounds you everywhere you go. Xemxija, although mostly known for being a quaint seaside town with a good variety of restaurants, was once an important spot for ancient civilisations, and an astonishing amount of historical sites can be found concentrated in what is now called the Xemxija Heritage Trail; what once was known as the Roman Road. This road also became known as the Pilgrims’ Way, as devout pilgrims travelled by this road to reach the famed sanctuary dedicated to Our Lady in Mellieha, usually after the fulfilment of a vow.

"western">The trail is easily found on Google Maps:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4356" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/map.png" alt="map" width="838" height="471" />
"western" >And i<span lang="mt-MT">t’</span>s very easy to follow. The road leading up to the start of the trail is <i>quite</i> the climb, but I can assure you, it’s totally worth the effort. At the beginning of the trail, you set foot on an uneven country road, flanked by an ancient Roman wall on the left side which is around 2000 years old. A lovely feature along this trail are the various information placards about different plant species – a thoughtful touch which will help you recognise the types of plants you’ll meet along the way. Slightly further up, another piece of history stands tall and proud – a prehistoric menhir (a large, standing stone) looms towards the sky, and is thought to be related to the burial rites during the Bronze Age (that’s roughly 2000BC). Right next to this imposing stone, uneven, rock-hewn steps lead into the first cavern: the Cave of the Galley (G<span lang="mt-MT">ħar ix-Xini). This cave was used as a human dwelling until some seventy years ago, even though it dates back even to Neolithic times. The cave is a welcome place to catch your breath after the climb to the start of the trail, and sweeping views over the Xemxija valley can be seen from its entrance.</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgqvHVtHzNm/?hl=enamp;taken-by=peacebloom12/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">Further up along the trail, on the right hand side, some more stone steps lead onto an open courtyard-like space, the whole left wall of which is occupied by </span>an apiary dating back to Roman times – scores of little niches carved into the rock, where bees would have been kept in order to produce the honey Malta was so known for. This beautiful space is flanked by stone benches overlooking the gorgeous Xemxija Bay – one can only imagine how breath-taking this scene must have looked before the rise of modern buildings. The apiaries are fully accessible and easily explored – a small doorway (mind your head, this door is super low!) leads into a longish stone-carved room, where ancient Romans harvested their honey. The details carved into the rock show the skill and craftsmanship of this ancient people. There are two apiaries, side by side, and both are free for anyone to explore!
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgqvT8bHVNy/?hl=enamp;taken-by=peacebloom12/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" >Towards the right hand side of the apiaries, a stone staircase leads to the upper level: here a large cave lies above, its mouth wide open like a hungry animal. From the carved plaque one can see that this is the Burial Cave (G<span lang="mt-MT">ħar il-Midfna), a resting place for ancient remains. The cave itself is easily accessed and includes some interesting shelves cleaved out of the rock. The view from this cave is also spectacular, and the cavern itself exudes a sense of calm. Walking straight on from the cave, a large and wise-looking tree spreads out. This is the oldest living carob tree in Malta, believed to be around 1000 years old. The roots of this tree are a web of tangles, scurrying over one-another in knots and twists. Two plaques lie at the base of the tree, a poem written by Frans Scerri in 1999 – one plaque bears the poem in Maltese, and the other in English.</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgqvt4kH616/?hl=enamp;taken-by=peacebloom12/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><span lang="mt-MT">The roots of the ancient carob become makeshift steps onto the next level, where another apiary can be found. This rock-carved beehive is known as the Rustic Apiary, and once you step into its dark interior, it becomes clear why. This apiary was decorated using a rubble wall, going all the way up to the ceiling. Parts of this rubble wall were formed as arches, creating quaint ancient niches. This Rustic cavern is also significantly larger than the other two, and it is easy to imagine this space bustling with ancient life. Stepping out from the darkness inside the cavern and back down the alternative root steps, the trail winds upwards, past the aforementioned Burial Cave. Towards the right-hand side, past a small megalith framing the entryway, a Punic tomb dating back to 5000BC can be seen. While this tomb is not accessible as it lies in a pit, an informative plaque helps to answer some questions. Going further along, past the Punic tomb, one finds a further two caves, as well as an old farmhouse. These caves were used as dwellings in ancient times, with one cave being used by the parents, the other by their children, and the farmhouse was used for keeping their animals. Helpful plaques shed light on the ancient history of these dwellings. Crossing onto a modern road, then going further down, you’ll come across the Roman baths – beautifully built structures which were used as public bathhouses during the time of the Romans. They sure chose a stunning location!</span>
[instagram url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfjZeVlAuPK/?hl=enamp;tagged=romanbathsxemxija/ hidecaption=true width=720]
"western" ><a name="_GoBack"></a><span lang="mt-MT">This trail is truly an experience in itself, and the best thing is: it’s totally free! That’s right, you get to wander around, touch, crawl into and live out these ancient sites at NO cost at all. The Xemxija Heritage Trail is a hiker’s paradise, and a history buff’s dream – there are literally historic sites round every corner, each bearing their own story. While i do encourage you to visit this trail and explore the heck out of it, please respect Mother Nature, and keep this area as you found it. Trash cans are hard to come by along this trail, so taking a small garbage bag with you for your trash would be best. Areas like these are a treasure to our heritage, and without preservation they would be lost to time. Make the most of being on an island as jam-packed with history as Malta is, and experience her ancient roots for yourself!</span>

            [blog_content] => <span lang="en-US">Thinking about visiting Malta in the spring? Well if you’re not you definitely should be! Experiencing the island around this time of the year means that you’ll be in for a Mediterranean treat. The Maltese spring is generally warmer than most, and there’s a pretty solid chance you’ll see many of the locals jumping at the chance to hit the beach, top up their tans, and splash around in our crystal-blue seas. Let’s take a closer look at why visiting Malta in spring is a fabulous idea:</span>
<span lang="en-US"><b>1. Awesome weather </b></span>
<span lang="en-US">If you love sunny weather but can’t take the full-on summer heat, this season is the perfect compromise. With temperatures usually hanging around the 17-to-25 degree mark, April and May are spot on. From lazy days at the beach to trekking, horse riding, kayaking and beyond, you will be able to enjoy everything the island has to offer without feeling like a sweaty mess at the end of it all. Win-win! </span>

            [blog_content] => Caponata,  a Sicilian and also a Maltese Dish must not be confused with the French Ratatouille.  Both use aubergine, but Caponata is flavored with sugar and vinegar whilst in Ratatouille, these ingredients do not feature.  Although Sicilian, in Malta, Kapunata is very popular especially in the hot summer months when eaten chilled with fresh crusty maltese bread.
There are many ways to serve Kapunata, on its own,  as a side dish with fresh fish especially, as a pasta sauce or glamorize it a bit and serve it with risotto milanese and parmesan crisps as a dinner party starter.
There are many recipes for Kapunata, and below you will find one of the Maltese versions:

            [blog_content] => Planning a family trip is never an easy feat, especially when young children are involved. The little ones are more easily irritated and can get grumpy really quickly, so you need to find ways to keep them entertained and avoid those dreaded tantrums! Most families on holiday have found that staying at a <a href="http://www.shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rental home</a> works much better for them than staying at a hotel – rental properties have all the amenities of an actual home, meaning you can prepare home-cooked meals (especially handy when you have small children) and kids still have a ‘household’ structure, instead of being confined to a room. Yet, it is a well-known fact that children get bored terribly quickly, so keeping them occupied and happy is a priority. We’ve listed 9 fun and engaging activities that your kids will love while on a family holiday to Malta which you can add to your vacation bucket list:

<ol>
	<li><b>Visit the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Lagoon</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BgmMUS8AdUX/?hl=enamp;tagged=bluelagooncomino
A family trip to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/comino-blue-lagoon-cruises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comino</a> is a must while in Malta. The smallest island is home to the clearest sea in the Mediterranean, and your kids will absolutely love it. It might actually be hard to tear them apart from the turquoise waters … but you can entice their sense of adventure with a:

<ol start="2">
	<li><b><a href="https://www.funmalta.com/gozo-jeep-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeep Ride in Gozo</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhYzoFKHKty/?hl=enamp;taken-at=246549639
Gozo is the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago, and it is by far the prettiest. With rolling green hills and beautiful seaviews all around the island, it is a nature lover’s paradise. It is awesome for kids too, especially when touring it atop a Jeep! The ride itself will be a fun experience for your children, while the places of interest will appeal to both adults and kids alike.

<ol start="3">
	<li><b>Compare your height to the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/prehistoric-temples-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temples’ stones</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/8ln3LBRnWu/?hl=enamp;taken-at=237187112
The <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/prehistoric-temples-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temples</a> of Hagar Qim and Mnajdra in Malta, as well as the temple of Ggantija in Gozo are known for their imposing size. Your children’s imagination will run wild trying to make sense of the huge stones and circular rooms in each temple. It would also be a fun family photo opportunity to take a photo beside the largest stone, comparing your height to the massive boulders. You can also compare your photo with how tall your kids have become on your next trip to Malta!

<ol start="4">
	<li><b>Throw a coin in the Triton Fountain</b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhLn92BH9OI/?hl=enamp;tagged=tritonfountain
We get it, it’s no Trevi Fountain, yet the newly refurbished Triton Fountain at Valletta’s entrance is still a fun little area to explore with kids. The square has been pedestrianised, so even the younger children can run around freely. Make sure to drop a coin and make a wish in the fountain with your family!

<ol start="5">
	<li><b>Watch the sunset at Golden Bay on <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horseback</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BbAUxsCnznq/?hl=enamp;tagged=goldenbayhorseriding
This is especially fun for older children, who are generally even harder to please. Watching the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/horse-riding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sunset at Golden Bay</a> is a must while on the island, and experiencing this wonderful time of the day on horseback is even more magical. #islandlife

<ol start="6">
	<li><b>Swim with the dolphins at <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/mediterraneo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mediterraneo Waterpark</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BWpUitelt8U/?hl=enamp;tagged=mediterraneomalta
Older and younger kids alike will be thrilled at the chance of swimming and interacting with dolphins and other sea creatures at the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/mediterraneo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mediterraneo water park</a>. Make sure to book this activity in advance to secure a spot, and take a video of the whole experience so they can relive it for years to come!

<ol start="7">
	<li><b>Spot a ghost on the <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/valletta-ghost-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valletta ghost tour</a></b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNnHD7-A-FS/?hl=enamp;tagged=vallettanight
This is another activity which older kids will surely enjoy. Book a ghost tour of Valletta and wander the historic city streets in the cover of night, while listening to some truly spooky tales of unquiet souls and restless spirits. Spine-tingling fun guaranteed!

<ol start="8">
	<li><b>Dress up and visit a Maltese festa</b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/4fMhJPtNtp/?hl=enamp;tagged=sannikola
When you visit Malta during the summer, you are sure to find a festa to visit every weekend. Do some research and find out which festa will be happening during your stay, then do as the Maltese do: don some fancy clothes, and take your family to the festa. You and your kids will experience a myriad of sounds and sights, making this activity one not to be missed!

<ol start="9">
	<li><b>Eat pastizzi</b></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhQSe32A-N-/?hl=enamp;tagged=pastizzi
Ah, the classic Maltese snack! Pastizzi are a delicious snack made of puff pastry and a filling of either ricotta or peas. The simplicity of this snack is sure to go down well with kids, yet adults will love eating pastizzi just as much. There are now even pastizzi filled with Nutella – just in case you wanted to have pastizzi for dessert too! (We don’t recommend showing this version to your kids, or they won’t want to eat anything else!)

            [blog_content] => The yearly tradition dictates that one should work towards a summer body during winter, yet work on a winter body in summer. Insulation is a must, and here at Shortlets Malta, we strive to help you in any way we possibly can (because we care, we really do). So here are the top 5 desserts to help you achieve that extra junk in the trunk, and where to find them:
<b>Milshakes at JAR, The Point, or The Plaza, Sliema: </b>
This milkshake is NOT for the faint hearted - it is rich, chocolatey, thick and oh so full of flavour. And speaking of flavours… what a variety! Featuring: childhood favourites like Cadbury and Kinder, aptly-named Caramel Bombs and Oreo shakes, and even The Healthy One for those of us who don’t want to induce a personal guilt-trip post-shake...there’s literally something for everyone. Feeling feisty? Try out their new Pina Colada shake for some extra buzz in your shake.

<b>Pancakes at Shoreditch Bar and Kitchen, Paceville: </b>
WARNING: once you read this particular post, you can never go back to enjoying a simple pancake. Ever. Not only has the team at Shoreditch Bar and Kitchen perfected the affordable gourmet burger, but they’ve also tempted us further into their homemade “sin of all sins” ; the ultra-famous, ultra-sought after Shoreditch Pancake Stack. Take your pick: are you a white chocolate lover? Try the new kitkat white pancake! Or maybe, you’re more of a classic milk chocolate kind of person…the Lindt Lindor pancake is just your thing! Seeing red? Go for the Red Velvet Pancake! The choice is honestly endless. Shortlets Malta suggests: bring friends so you can go halfsies on every pancake and try them all! <u><b></b></u>

<b>Doughnuts at Crust, St Julians: </b>
This new deli bakery prides itself on the fact that everything they serve is baked fresh, daily. The ambience is modern, unique and stylish, the savouries are to die for, but the real star of the entire enterprise is The Doughnut. With fillings such as pistachio, strawberry, cherry and cranberry, Nutella, coconut and kinder Bueno, it is hard to resist these babies. Try one, or try them all (in one sitting) and your taste buds will thank you forever.

<b>French Toast at Manouche, Craft Bakery and Bistro, St Julians: </b>
This new and very aesthetically appealing bakery is perfect for an afternoon treat after a day by the beach. Apart from a delicious breakfast menu, Manouche boasts of the best French Toast on the island, and no one dares contest it! Their Pain Perdu (a.k.a French Toast) is made with a unique, organic wheat brioche, brûlée banana, roasted peanut butter, Canadian maple syrup amp; vanilla creme fraiche; and it is a treat for the stomach, as well for the eyes.

<b>Sticky Toffee Pudding, Fat Louie’s, Paceville: </b>
A timeless, classic masterpiece: Fat Louie’s is known for its successful experimentation with regards to different variations of cuisine, yet the team hit a soft spot when adding the sticky toffee pudding to the list of desserts. Its moist, soft texture paired with a sticky pool of toffee, accompanied with soft-serve ice cream: a true symphony of warm and cold paired with rich, enticing, yet comforting flavour. This is the dessert to have after any of their main dishes.

            [blog_content] => Whether you’re planning and booking a well-deserved mini-break or organising the round-the-world adventure of your dreams, knowing where you’re going to rest your weary feet and recharge after another action-packed day is often a top priority for travellers and tourists alike. Opting for <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/all_properties_menu.html"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>short-let accommodation in Malta</u></span></a> is a great, cost-effective way to make sure you find your home away from home with more privacy and independence than other accommodation types would typically offer.
But what should you look for when you’re doing that all-important research? Let’s take a quick look at some key points for you to consider:
<b>1. Range </b>
It’s nice to be spoiled for choice, isn’t it? When you’re looking at potential providers, take a look at what types of properties are available <b>and </b>the range of locations they’re available in. Do you want to be close to the entertainment capital, or would you prefer something a little more laid back? Do you want a villa close to the sea, or an apartment in our majestic capital city, Valletta? We’ve got a property to suit every taste and budget.
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhmDF8PZDtSNjFAI/giphy.gif" />

<b>2. Clear, accurate photos</b>
Steer clear of any kind of accommodation offerings that do not provide any (or indeed enough) photos of what you are paying for. Ideally, you want to be able to see photos of the bedroom/s, bathroom/s, kitchen, lounge and (if this applies) the pool area too. That way, you know what to expect and can hold the provider accountable if you don’t get what was advertised.

<b>3. Dates, prices, options</b>
Who has time to waste? Not us! When you’re interested in a property, you want to know exactly how much it’ll cost and whether or not it’s available right away. That’s why when you visit <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortletsmalta.com</a> you can punch in your details and get quotes and availability right away! Simple.
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IyiKbiDdEalPyes/giphy.gif" />

<b>4. Get social</b>
Social media is a great way to get to know a company, see what people are saying about it, and check out what’s on offer. On that note, you can keep up to date with our short let properties and all the Maltese fun you could possibly want via our Facebook page! Hit that like button to stay informed.

<b>5. Quality customer service </b>
If anything <i>does </i>go wrong, you want to feel like you can talk to your provider and that they’ll get it sorted ASAP. When you choose <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Short Lets Malta</a>, you can get in touch with us any time - we’ve got you covered.

            [blog_content] => Malta - the small island with a very big personality indeed. One of the things we love most about our three sun-drenched pieces of Mediterranean paradise is this: no matter how many times you’ve visited, or how long you have lived here, there is always something new to discover. From technicolour sunsets that need no filter, to <a href="https://www.funmalta.com/trekking"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>scenic treks</u></span></a> through the rugged Maltese countryside, secret, long-forgotten caves to explore and beyond, there’s no end to the things you’ll see here.

            [blog_content] => Sunsets are a gift at the end of each day, and Malta is surely blessed with some great spots where these daily marvels can be viewed. The best sunsets in Malta can be seen from the Western side of the islands, West being the direction in which the sun sets. Watching sunsets is a perfect way to end a spring or summer day, so here are some of our favourite sunset-viewing spots on the Maltese Islands.

<ol>
	<li><strong>Golden Bay</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BgMZQBAg_Qb/?hl=enamp;tagged=goldenbaymalta
The fiery Golden Bay is a spectacle during all times of the day; however this beach takes on new life during sunsets. The warm hues play well with the beach’s orange sand, which offers a comfy prime location from which to view a majestic sunset or two.

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Dingli Cliffs</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgohys6FOJ8/?hl=enamp;taken-at=236387442
The majestic Dingli cliffs offer an uninterrupted view out to sea, perfect for witnessing an end to another day in the most beautiful of ways. Unlike Golden Bay, this location isn’t as comfortable, however there are a few dispersed benches which offer a place to rest while watching the sun dissolve into the Mediterranean. Make sure to take a blanket or a cardi while sunset-watching here, as the Cliffs get quite chilly as soon as the sun sets!

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>It-Torri l-Ahmar</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BedjXcTH_lY/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1001771327
Located on top of a hill in Mellieha, it-Torri l-Ahmar might not seem like the most accessible of spots. Yet it is fairly easy to get to, and the view from up there is truly something. Venture further into the area and find a cosy spot overlooking the sea for some Instagram worthy #sunset shots. This spot is also great for sunrise watching, as the hill provides great views on both sides.

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Blue Lagoon</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhwgpItgEj5/?hl=enamp;tagged=comino
Sunsets at the Blue Lagoon in Comino are even more magical – the crystal clear waters offer an idyllic backdrop to the dramatic setting of the sun. The big bonus of this location is that you can enjoy the natural spectacle while swimming in the clearest water in the Mediterranean; something which you don’t get to do every day!

<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Xlendi Bay</strong></li>
</ol>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BfdaIpFnKrA/?hl=enamp;tagged=xlendi
<a name="_GoBack"></a>Xlendi Bay in Gozo seems to have been created for the sole purpose of sunset-watching. The valley’s cliffs frame the sun’s setting perfectly during the summer, with the sun descending into the sea in the middle of the horizon. Grab an ice cream or a couple of cocktails from the many restaurants and bars on the beach front, and prepare to be blown away!

As much as you might enjoy bringing back that “Hey everyone I was on holiday” tan as a souvenir, it is 2018, and by now it is a well known fact that the sun is NOT your friend. From heatstroke to skin cancer, the sun can truly be an enemy. The obvious solution to unbearable heat is to go to the beach, but that’s not always viable (more on that later).
<span style="font-size:small;"> </span>

The question is, how are you going to keep up your “beach bae” status and still treat your body as a temple this summer? Here at ShortLets Malta, we care about your reputation and your health; we’ve therefore compiled a list of ways you can take care of yourself whilst enjoying your holiday of a lifetime. Here are 5 ways to deal with a Maltese Summer this 2018.
<b>1.Drink lots of water: </b>Let’s face it- this is probably the most basic, yet most important tip we can offer. With possible highs of 42ºC this year, your average 8 glasses a day just won’t do! The EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) recommends an average of 2 litres a day for women, and an average of 2.5 litres a day for men. Avoiding sugar, additives and calories in your drinks is also a must, and supplementing your daily pint (or two) of beer by the beach with water will ensure that you stay super hydrated. Carry a bottle of cold water wherever you go, as you never know when you might need it the most!

https://www.instagram.com/p/BhgzPbCl7AY/?tagged=maltabeach
<b>2. Wear Sunscreen: </b>It’s our most effective tool against the sun (except, of course, when it comes to staying out of the sun, but it’s summer so why would you?). It reflects of absorbs those pesky UV rays, whilst protecting your skin against wrinkles, moles and sagging skin. It is recommended that one wears sunscreen of SPF 30 or even higher, to be applied every hour or so, especially if you’re by the pool, at the beach, or actively sweating. Don’t forget to apply sunscreen to your ears, face, neck…even your lips!
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhLrSRrn_Me/?tagged=maltabeach
<b>3. Avoid peak hours: </b>If you’re spending a<b> </b>day by the beach with your family and/or friends, remember this important bit of information: the sun gets particularly hot and unbearable between 12pm-4pm. It is SUPER recommended that those hours are spent under the shade of an umbrella, or indoors. If being outside cannot be avoided, refer to tip number two (2) over, and over, and over, and over again.

<b>4. Know which beach to hit: </b>It is important to update yourself daily on which beach to visit that day. Wind and sea conditions can make it dangerous to swim that day, which is why the Malta Red Cross and Malta’s 100.2 FM Radio collaborated and came up with the Which Beach website (follow this link: <a href="https://whichbeach.com.mt/"><u><b>https://whichbeach.com.mt</b></u></a>), updated daily to provide you with the best beach to visit on the day, and all the information you might need on that particular beach. Look out for coloured flags found on said beach; blue flags mean that the beach is clean, safe and enjoy the highest quality of bathing water, whilst green flags mark safe to bathe beaches. On the other hand, look out for yellow, red and double red flags: yellow indicates low danger, red indicates high danger, and double red flags indicate extreme danger.

<b>5. Know your beach laws: </b>Even though its 2018, and #freethenipple was and still is a thing in modern society, sunbathing topless on a Maltese beach is not legal. Skinny dipping is also quite illegal, and walking around towns and villages in a bikini or shirtless after a day at the beach can also lead to fines (not exactly the memento you were expecting to take back home).

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Stumped on what gifts to get for family and friends after a memorable trip to The Maltese Islands? This week we bring you 8 artisanal gifts that are unique as much as they are representative of Malta and Gozo’s arts, crafts and cultural heritage to give and share back home. Read on!</span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Filigree Jewellery </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4419 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh.jpg" alt="gh" width="423" height="486" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">As a form of metalwork, filigree jewellery is created from silver and gold and is renowned for its delicate and intricate appearance. For a wide selection of designs head to St. Lucia or Merchants Street in Valletta where several jewellery shops offer a wide selection of pendants, earrings and bracelets. We recommend searching for designs that feature the Maltese cross.</span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Lace </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4420 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh1.jpg" alt="gh1" width="430" height="363" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Lace-making is Malta’s quintessential traditional craft that extends back to the 16</span></span><sup><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">th</span></span></sup><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"> century. It conjures up images of women sitting outside crafting lace whilst enjoyi</span></span><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">ng the cooler evening air and in some rural areas, this tradition is alive and a vibrant aspect of village life. That said, handmade lace with high craftsmanship tends to be quite expensive and hard to come by. However, several gift shops provide manufactured versions of the more traditional and wrought designs that still make for a unique gift. </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Natural Soap </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4421 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh2.jpg" alt="gh2" width="432" height="493" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">The Maltese Islands are home to a vast array of Mediterranean plants that may be used for their essential oils and cleansing properties. Prickly pear, orange, natural herbs and olive oil all make for wonderful additions to soaps and cleansers with something for every skin type. SoapCafe in Sliema offers a selection of soap and other items made with Maltese ingredients. </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Handmade Glass Items </b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4422 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh3.jpg" alt="gh3" width="430" height="392" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Handmade glassware makes for mesmerising patterns and designs that stand to brighten and decorate any room. Mdina Glass is arguably the most renowned for this craft with stores spread across the island and tours open for visitors to observe their craftsmen in Ta’ Qali (Malta). Opt for a small paperweight or a more intricate vase or lamp for an artistic reminder of your trip. </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Gozitan Salt</b></span></span>

<img class="  wp-image-4423 aligncenter" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh4.jpg" alt="gh4" width="433" height="497" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">No trip to Gozo is complete without a visit to the iconic globigerina limestone formations and saltpans in Marsalforn. The 350-year-old saltpans are located on a 3km stretch of coastline and are central to Gozo’s multi-generational sea-salt production. Locals collect the salt during the hot summer months, store and then process it in limestone caves in the area. The packaged salt is then sold to locals and tourists alike. Some sellers set up shop in the area specifically for tourists although be sure to head over in the late summer-autumn months! </span></span>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Indigenous Wine Varieties </b></span></span>
<img class="alignnone  wp-image-4424" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh5.jpg" alt="gh5" width="443" height="508" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Viticulture is a small yet high-quality industry in the Maltese Islands with many local wineries producing international as well as local varieties of wine. Wineries produce two kinds of indigenous grapes and wine: Ġellewża and Għirgħentina. Head over to any of the main local wineries such as Marsovin, Delicata or Meridiana for a taste and a chance to purchase some of these varieties. </span></span>

<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;"><b>Local Food Products </b></span></span>
<img class="alignnone  wp-image-4425" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gh6.jpg" alt="gh6" width="430" height="492" />
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Are you planning gifts for avid foodies back home? Opt for local food items that are packaged with travelling in mind. Jubilee Foods (located in Victoria – Gozo and Valletta – Malta) offer a wide array of sweet and savoury local items ranging from jams made with local fruit to the iconic cheeselet made with goat’s cheese. Just make sure to get them to the intended person as soon as possible or you’ll decide to keep them for yourself before they do!</span></span><a name="_GoBack"></a>
<span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size:large;">Care to tell us which of these items would be a hit back home? Let us know in the comments below.</span></span>

            [blog_content] => Nothing beats the smell of freshly baked Maltese bread. Locally referred to as ‘Hobz tal-Malti’, Maltese bread tastes like no other bread in the world! We have followed the bread baking process at Falzon Bakery in Rabat who are still following an old recipe and bake their bread inside a traditional wood fired oven.

            [blog_content] => <span style="font-size:medium;">Travelling with kids on a family vacation is a great way to bond and grow as a family. Now that summer is approaching and children worldwide can enjoy a time of relaxation school-free, many families decide to embark on a family adventure, and venture out into an unknown location for a much-needed family holiday. Travelling with kids in tow can be a challenging experience, sometimes proving to be even more stressful than everyday life. Yet some of these stresses can be kept at bay with a few simple tricks, ensuring a peaceful and tranquil holiday for both kids and parents. Planning on exploring a new location with your family this summer? Check out our tried and tested tips for a smooth-sailing family vacation! </span>

<h3 class="western">Rent a Vacation Home</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4489" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/villablu.jpg" alt="VillaBlu" width="797" height="532" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">When deciding where to stay on your family trip, it is always best to choose the ideal accommodation for you and your family members. Opting for a vacation home instead of a hotel room works much better for families, providing you with ample space and with a home environment, which helps children adapt to their new accommodation better. Family rooms in hotels tend to feel cramped and claustrophobic, leaving kids annoyed and cranky. Make sure to choose a vacation home to suit your budget and family needs – if you’re planning on exploring for most of your stay, then an <a href="http://shortletsmalta.com/Sunny_2-bedroom_with_Jacuzzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a></span><b> </b><span style="font-size:medium;">would be a great option, whereas if you’re planning on relaxing for most of your holiday, then a vacation <a href="https://www.luxuryvillasmalta.com/villa-blu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">villa</a></span><span style="font-size:medium;"><b>, </b></span><span style="font-size:medium;">complete with pool and various amenities would be the ideal choice. </span>

<h3 class="western">Keep your kids entertained</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4488" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/babytablet.jpg" alt="BabyTablet" width="5184" height="3456" />
This is especially relevant if your kids are still young and get bored easily. Bringing a tablet full of their favourite TV shows and cartoons can be a life-saver when travelling, and make sure to pack your HDMI cable so that you can connect the tablet directly to the TV feed. Downloading some colouring apps or educational games will also keep kids entertained and happy, and you can choose apps depending on your child’s interests. Children, whatever their age, get bored easily, so while the National Museum of Archaeology may seem like a wonderland of artefacts for you, it sounds like the most boring thing ever for your kids. Be prepared and avoid meltdowns with distractions as soon as irritability hits!

<h3 class="western">Bring ‘rewards’ for those dreaded long transits</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4494" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/reward1.jpg" alt="Reward" width="5184" height="3456" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">Travelling is generally awesome, and a great way to expand your kids’ world-view. However it can also be tiring, especially when long travelling times are involved. Even adults get cantankerous on long-haul flights or coach rides, let alone little ones. There is no sure way to avoid tantrums or melt-downs, and the best way to deal with these outbursts is to go with the flow and not worry too much about them before they actually happen. However it never hurts to be equipped for the worst, and this includes bringing ‘rewards’ such as small toys or colouring books to recompense good behaviour. Kids will be entertained by the novelty of the ‘reward’ for their manners, keeping them busy and happy for more precious travelling time. </span>

<h3 class="western">Rent whatever equipment you can</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4496" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/stroller1.jpg" alt="Stroller" width="2560" height="1707" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">When travelling with kids, it is always better to travel as light as you can, thereby avoiding long waits at the luggage retrieval section at the airport, problems with fitting your entire luggage on transport and unnecessary headaches of lost luggage. Whatever equipment you can rent on site, rent it! From strollers, to high chairs and cots, most locations will offer rental options which will save you time and packing space. Vacation rental properties offer high chairs and baby cots on demand as well, meaning less worrying for vacationing parents! </span>

<h3 class="western">Take it easy – don’t pack too many activities in one day</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4495" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/takeiteasyfamily1.jpg" alt="TakeItEasyFamily" width="6720" height="4480" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">Travelling alone and travelling as a family have their similarities – yet day planning is not one of them. While it may be tempting to pack as many activities as you can into one day, and while this plan may work when travelling alone, it will generally result in very grumpy and very tired kiddos. While planning day to day vacation activities even when travelling with kids is a smart way to travel, make sure to not over-plan your days, as anything and everything may happen when vacationing with kids in tow. Keep your days light, plan one or two activities per day, and take it from there. If your kids are feeling up to it and still have high energy levels then wing it and decide on a new activity there and then. You’ll be thankful for not over-stuffing your days after a tired kid’s meltdown at the end of a tour. </span>

<h3 class="western">Packing list – write everything down</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4498" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/packinglist.jpg" alt="PackingList" width="1920" height="993" />
<span style="font-size:medium;">By now most travellers swear by the packing list – you can start compiling this list as early as you wish, adding essential things to pack as you remember them. The list becomes even more vital when travelling as a family, where each family member has their own indispensable items to bring on holiday. You can involve older kids in the packing fun by giving them their own list to compile, thereby ensuring that they bring their favourite items along too. Younger kids can be given a pictographic list of important items to pack, transforming packing their bag into a little game. Also, give each child their own personal bag – younger children will feel more responsible and grown-up carrying their very own luggage!</span>

<h3 class="western">Buy disposable items when you arrive</h3>
<span style="font-size:medium;">While we do encourage that you pack </span><span style="font-size:medium;"><i>some </i></span><span style="font-size:medium;">disposable items (such as nappies and wet wipes) for your trip, don’t stuff your bags with them. Chances are you’ll be able to buy these items from the local supermarket wherever you’re visiting, often finding the same brands you find at home. Pack a few nappies and wet wipes to last your journey, then head to the local supermarket or pharmacy and buy these items on arrival. You’ll save up so much luggage space using this method - meaning you’ll have more room for items which are truly indispensable for your trip. </span>

            [blog_content] => Located on Malta’s west coast, Dingli Cliffs are the highest point on the island standing at 253m above sea level. The cliffs are perfect for peaceful walks while admiring the stunning panoramic views and an endless horizon. It’s hard to describe the beauty of this location at sunset and visiting at this time is highly recommended.

One cannot picture Malta without picturing churches and chapels, monumental proof of the island’s deep Catholic roots. It is said that there are 365 churches and chapels around the islands, one for every day of the year. Most of these religious temples are sky-high, adorned with imposing columns and great domes and steeples. Yet Malta is also dotted with quaint limestone chapels, not much bigger than a room, some of which date back to medieval times. Today we take a tour of 8 of these charming chapels around Malta, beautiful testimonies of the island’s faith since early times.
<strong>Chapel of St Mary Magdalene – Dingli</strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BftEtk4AIck/?hl=enamp;taken-at=236387442
The chapel perched precariously on the vertiginous cliffs of Dingli is perhaps one of the best known chapels on the island. Visitors strolling the cliffs are sure to encounter this modest chapel, while some even start their cliff exploration using her as a starting point. The chapel is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, however it is also known as the Chapel of the Cliffs. The earliest records show that the chapel has been standing treacherously in its place since 1446, and it used to be the go-to church for the farmers of the area.

<strong>Chapel of Our Lady of Atocia, known as tas-Samra – Hamrun</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BJDktlHB6Si/?hl=enamp;tagged=tassamra
The Chapel of Our Lady of Atocia in Hamrun is one of the lesser known churches on this list. Tucked away in a small alleyway in the central town of Hamrun, the chapel known as ‘Tas-Samra’ to the Maltese (the name, meaning ‘of the tanned Lady’, derives from the icon found in the church depicting a dark-skinned Madonna) was built as the chapel we know today in 1630. This chapel is peculiar as it is fairly larger than most chapels’ layouts, and it has a beautiful arched façade, built in the Spanish style.

<strong>Church of Our Lady of the Snows – Marsaxlokk</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BTn5D5ijWH8/?hl=enamp;taken-at=238721887
Suspended above the picturesque town of Marsaxlokk is the grand-looking chapel of Our Lady of the Snows, known among the locals as ‘Tas-Silg’. This chapel’s location has been used as a place of worship since ancient times, and we learn from Cicero that a temple dedicated to Juno stood on this spot during Roman rule. However this location had been used as a temple even by the Phoenicians, who erected a temple dedicated to Astarte here, while the Carthaginians transformed this temple into a place of worship to their god Melkart. The site near the chapel is also an archaeological site, still closed to the public as excavations are ongoing. The chapel dates back to 1650; however the structure was rebuilt again in 1832.

<strong>Immaculate Conception Chapel  - Ahrax, Mellieha</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BZBc0AnjEPN/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1133102863387974
Ahrax Point in Mellieha is one of the northernmost points on the island, right on the edge of Malta’s ‘tail’. When one reaches this point two features stand out: the niche standing at the very edge of the cliffs, and the peaceful little chapel, humble and inconspicuous. This chapel is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, and unlike most of the other churches in this list, is not all that old. The earliest records depicting this chapel date it back to the beginning of the 20th Century, a relative new-born when compared to the other chapels around the island. The original chapel stood even closer to the edge of the cliffs, yet the placement was changed due to erosion of the cliffs below.

<strong>The Chapel of Our Lady of Itria – Bingemma</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/5zEUMLPzHF/?taken-at=74290334
Another chapel dangling perilously on the edge of a valley is the chapel of Our Lady of Itria, in the scenic hamlet of Bingemma. ‘Itria’ derives from the Orthodox nomenclature Hodegetria, meaning ‘she who knows the way’. This chapel was built in 1600, when many devotees revered the Madonna of Itria. What is amazing about this chapel it its location. To the right of the chapel, an uneven pathway leads down to a quaint valley, the sides of which are pockmarked by a series of tombs, or rock hewn caves. Mystery still shrouds this area, as archaeologists still do not agree on whether these caverns were used as tombs, or whether they were ancient dwellings.

<strong>Chapel of St Paul the Hermit – Wied il-Ghasel, Mosta</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BhgnI8vg1fv/?taken-at=1033519944
Wied il-Ghasel in Mosta has been forever immortalised in a popular Maltese song, highlighting the beauty of the area. The chapel of St Paul the Hermit adds further charm and exquisiteness to the already fascinating area; the chapel is built in a natural cave opening, incorporating the cave walls into its own structure. The legend surrounding this chapel goes that a saintly hermit lived in the cave before the chapel was built. Some Maltese had started living immorally, and had received fair warnings from the hermit who advised them to change their life’s course. Relentless, and seeing that the hermit lived such a pious life, they decided to tempt him into a life of sin, sending a woman down to his cave in order to seduce him. The hermit could not take their taunting any longer and therefore decided to head first to Comino, then to Gozo. Instead of taking a boat as one would normally do when crossing over to the islands, the hermit lay down his cloak on the water, and travelled on it as if it were a raft. Upon seeing this miraculous event, the Maltese people realised that he was a saint, and asked for his forgiveness. They built a small chapel where the hermit used to dwell, and dedicated it to St Paul the Hermit.

<strong>Chapel of St Matthew – Maqluba, Qrendi</strong>

It seems that the Maltese had a knack for building chapels hazardously close to the edge. Yet the chapel of St Matthew in Qrendi is an exception. This chapel dates as far back as the 11th century, before the Maqluba sinkhole was formed. It is said that the chapel avoided destruction by the sinkhole miraculously, after the village that stood where the sinkhole is now located was destroyed and engulfed by the earth in a violent storm in 1343. The chapel that stands there today is composed of two adjoining chapels – known as ‘iz-Zghir’ (the small) and ‘il-Kbir’ (the large). The larger chapel was built in 1682.

<strong>Immaculate Conception Chapel – Spinola Bay, St Julian’s</strong>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BiStJNtAk8X/?tagged=spinolabay
Camouflaged among the modern buildings and restaurants along Spinola Bay, one finds a small chapel dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. At first glance, the chapel is almost unnoticeable, as it blends into the hodgepodge of buildings along the seafront. Back when St Julian’s was an idle fishermen’s village, this unassuming chapel served as a place of worship for the workers of the area, and it was known by the name ‘tas-Sajjieda’ meaning ‘of the fishermen’. Nowadays the chapel has been squashed on both sides by imposing modern buildings, yet she holds on steadfastly and looks out to the bay whose fishermen she once served. The site was first used in 1580, when a church known as ‘ta’ Lapsi’ was built after the Great Siege. The church as we know it today was built in 1688 by Fra Paolo Rafel Spinola, whose name is still connected to the area to this day.

            [blog_content] => After that disappointing Eurovision result (sob), Malta needs a little pick-me-up: the entire Isle of MTV lineup has been revealed, and all your favourite artists will be arriving on the 27th of June! Here’s all you need to know about the artists who will be joining Like Mike and Dimitri Vegas in this year’s open air festival.
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3HuJwtaLm1RBLEJOp1/giphy.gif" />

<strong>Jason Derulo</strong>
This is Derulo’s second trip to Malta; he’s already performed at the music festival in 2015, so we’re expecting him to be on fire this year! Derulo rose to fame back in 2009, with popular hits such as “In my Head”, “Whatcha Say” and “Don’t Wanna Go Home”. More recently the American artist released the hit singles “Want to Want Me” and “Swalla”. We’re suspecting that Derulo will preview some exclusive performances from his upcoming 2018 album, entitled “777”. We’ll just have to wait and see what he has in store for us!

<strong>Hailee Steinfeld</strong>
This gorgeous American actress/singer is only 21 years old, yet she’s already dominated the big screen with an Oscar nomination for her role in “True Grit”, her role in “Pitch Perfect 2” and “Pitch Perfect 3” (featuring other stars such as Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson”, and has also conquered the charts with her new 2017 singles “Most Girls” and “Let Me Go”. Steinfeld is also wrapping up her debut studio album as we speak, so let’s collectively pray for some exclusive album sneak-peaks!

<strong>Sigala</strong>
Also known as Bruce Fielder, this English DJ, record producer and remixer from Norfolk has already taken over the UK Singles Chart with his 2015 singles “Easy Love”, featuring vocals from the famous Jackson 5’s “ABC”, and “Sweet Lovin’”. Another single, “Lullaby”, this time featuring the vocals of Paloma Faith, was released in February 2018, and will surely be performed during the music festival. Just like his peers, Sigala has also recorded a studio album, to be released as early as 20th July 2018. Stay tuned!

<strong>Paloma Faith</strong>
As previously mentioned, Paloma Faith will be lending her live vocals to Sigala’s performance this year. Yet don’t be fooled, the English actress, singer and songwriter is a force to be reckoned with. Her retro-inspired album “Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?” came out back in 2009, reaching double platinum status and a BRIT award nomination. Her second album, “Fall to Grace”, reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart. She’s also appeared in films such as “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus”, “St. Trinian’s” and the widely acclaimed television talent show “The Voice UK”. Expect only greatness from this artist!

<strong>Ella Eyre</strong>
Another great artist performing alongside Sigala, Eyre will be displaying her gorgeous vocal abilities performing the hit single “Came here for Love”. Eyre first rose to prominence via her hit single with Rudimental, entitled “Waiting all Night”. Her next three solo singles, “If I Go”, “Together” and “Comeback” reached the top 20 in the UK Singles Charts, and she hasn’t stopped there. On 5th March, 2018, Eyre announced her new single, “Answerphone”, which peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. Get ready for a performance of a lifetime!

NB: This festival is a free one; all are welcome to enjoy the concert! However, due to overcrowding, tickets will need to be acquired to attend the show. Fans will have the option to pre-register for the event, which will be open for two weeks prior to the official ticketing launch- each individual is allowed a maximum of four tickets. On the day of the event, both printed and digital tickets will be accepted at the various entrances to the concert. Sounds fair, no? Save the date, and get booking!

            [blog_content] => A small bar just 5 minutes away from the old capital of Mdina, the Crystal Palace (known as is-Serkin) is somewhat of an institution with the locals.
Serving some of the best ‘Pastizzi’ on the island and tea served in glasses, is-Serkin provides a taste of times past. Fresh, tasty and piping hot, these little pastries are hard to resist!

            [blog_content] => <span lang="mt-MT">We have already covered our islands’ best sunset-viewing spots, so it was only natural that we would also show you the best locations for witnessing grandiose sunrises. Dawn may not be as favoured a time of day, simply because many people would rather sleep for a couple of more minutes than wake up early. For those of you who aren’t discouraged by an impending alarm, or who are coming back from a night out in the wee hours of the morning, or out jogging or exercising before the day begins: this list’s for you! Here are our top sunrise spotting sites on the Maltese Islands.</span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Grand Harbour, Valletta</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BUqcfv8huS3/?hl=enamp;tagged=vallettasunrise
<span lang="mt-MT">The Grand Harbour is a prime sunrise viewing spot, giving you an unobstructed view of the horizon. Head to the capital before it becomes hoarded with people, grab a coffee from the kiosks near the bus terminus, and walk straight down Republic Street to get to the tip of the Valletta peninsula , then head down to the coast for a truly unforgettable sunrise experience. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Surfside Rocky Beach, Sliema</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNNEyiKFFj3/?hl=enamp;tagged=sliemasunrise
<span lang="mt-MT">The whole coastline of Sliema offers some truly spectacular sunrise spots, yet sitting on the rocks at Surfside, hearing the soft lapping of the waves against the shore, is an experience in itself. Whether you stop and take in the view while on your morning jog, or you take a break on your way home from St Julian’s after a good night out, this sunrise sight is sure to leave you speechless. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">St Thomas Bay, Marsascala</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BViGVqCli6K/?hl=enamp;taken-at=1027339170
<span lang="mt-MT">If you find yourself in the southern part of Malta in the early hours of the morning, make sure to head over to St Thomas Bay in Marsascala to witness a beautiful dawn over the turuoise sea of the bay. This spot is also ideal for a bit of early swimming, especially during the summer months when the sun starts sizzling as soon as it rises. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Birgu Shoreline</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh4i-FzAzDY/?hl=enamp;taken-at=181295
<span lang="mt-MT">The shoreline on the Kalkara side of Birgu is a great location to sit by the sea in a peaceful environment. Paired with a fiery sunrise, this spot becomes even more magical. Nestled between Fort St Angelo and the Bighi Hospital in Kalkara, this sunrise spot offers a different point of view of the Grand Harbour, ideal for some sweet Instagram snaps!</span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Ta’ Xbiex Coastline</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BhH2D9klLbj/?hl=enamp;taken-at=257223367
<span lang="mt-MT">This coastline stretching from Msida to Gzira is a top spot for watc</span>hing a beautiful sunrise framed by Valletta’s iconic coast on one side, and Manoel Island on the other. The sun rises between these two expanses of land and creates a breath-taking silhouette effect. The area is also dotted with quaint cafes, meaning you can recharge with some java before starting your day.
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Cittadella, Gozo</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/BfSVWAYjuer/?hl=enamp;tagged=gozosunrise

<span lang="mt-MT">If you’re staying in Gozo while on your trip, watching the sunrise from the ancient wall city of Cittadella, just above the Gozitan capital Victoria. The city was built on top of one of the highest hills in Gozo, giving you a broad view over the whole island. Head over to the bastions on the eastern side of the city to witness a wonderful sunrise above Malta and Comino, then grab a couple of </span><span lang="mt-MT"><i>pastizzi</i></span><span lang="mt-MT"> and a typical </span><span lang="mt-MT"><i>te fit-tazza</i></span><span lang="mt-MT"> (tea in a glass) for a truly memorable experience. </span>
"western"><strong><span lang="mt-MT">Qbajjar Salt Pans, Gozo</span></strong>
https://www.instagram.com/p/4PrKGGLFUZ/?hl=enamp;tagged=gozosunrise
<span lang="mt-MT">If you’re in the Marsalforn area at around 6am, you must go to the Qbajjar salt pans to view the sunrise. The salt pans reflect the sky in the most enchanting way, making dawn even more dazzling and dramatic. Afterwards, a quick dip in the pebbly beach of Qbajjar will surely refresh you and prepare you for the day ahead!</span>

            [blog_content] => If you want to visit a typical Maltese village, look no further than gorgeous “L-Imgarr”- a village known for its history, culture, and more importantly, its food. Mgarr is found within the Northern Regions of Malta, particularly closest to Mosta and adjacent to Mellieha. Known for its fertile farmland and vineyards, Mgarr is a predominantly agricultural area, home to many of the island’s farmers. Its peaceful surroundings warrant a day’s visit- here is Shortlet Malta’s guide to the lovely village of Mgarr!
<strong>1.Ta’ Hagrat Temples:</strong> Mgarr has two important prehistoric sites both of which are still in great condition and UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Ta’ Hagrat is a megalithic temple found just outside of Mgarr’s town centre, which happens to be divided in two- one larger megalithic temple belonging to the Ggantija phase (3600-3200 BCE) and a smaller temple dating back to the Saflieni phase (3300-3000 BCE). The site was excavated by Malta’s very own Sir Temi Zammit between 1923 and 1926, and plenty of antique pottery was found on site.

<strong>2. Skorba Temples:</strong> Mgarr’s second prehistoric site and megalithic temple is found a mere kilometer outside the Ta’ Hagrat Temple area. The Skorba Temples are not as well preserved as Ta’ Hagrat Temples are, however what is fascinating about this temple is not what the eye beholds, but rather the discoveries made due to it. The Skorba area seems to have been inhabited way back in the very early in the Neolithic period, and the deposits found at its base contained matrial which dated back to the first known human occupation of Malta, circa 4850 BC!

<strong>3. Neighbouring Beaches:</strong> When visiting Mgarr, you are never too far from the beach: Gnejna Bay, Golden Bay and Ghajn Tuffieha are only a 10 minute drive from the village centre. All three beaches are predominantly sandy beaches, with convenient rocky areas. Golden Bay and Ghajn Tuffieha sit adjacent to each other; whilst Ghajn Tuffieha promotes quiet, nature-loving surroundings, Golden Bay boasts a “party-like” environment, with volleyball tournaments being held, bars, restaurants, barbecues and even beach parties. Gnejna Bay, on the other hand, is a small, golden sanded beach, great for family trips. Take your pick- they are all beautiful in their own unique ways!

<strong>4. Nature Trails and Hiking Opportunities:</strong> Feeling active and adventurous? Mgarr is a mecca for hikers and nature-lovers alike. For the more adventurous souls, Fomm ir-Rih is the ideal place for trekking, snorkelling and diving. Boasting incredulous views and a secluded beach, it is perfect for those who enjoy a struggle to then relax all day long. For those of us who prefer more relaxing walks, Mgarr is only a short drive away from scenic areas such as Victoria Lines and Bingemma- unobstructed countryside views await you!

<strong>5. Enjoy a “Fenkata”:</strong> For those lucky few who can get over the fact that rabbit are super duper cute and the guilt of eating them, a fenkata is just the thing you need to feel like a proper Malteser. Head over to il-Barri, a restaurant right next to the Mgarr Parish Church (hard to miss!) and enjoy a bountiful meal of anything that is typically Maltese: dips and “galletti” (crackers) as an appetizer, a bowl of spaghetti with rabbit sauce as a starter, and a nice chunk of rabbit for your main. There is truly nothing like having to move the belt buckle a hole or two down after filling your belly with gorgeous Maltese food!

            [blog_content] => The Mosta dome has one of the largest unsupported domes in the world and is one of the most fascinating churches in Malta. This church miraculously survived the second world war when a high explosive bomb pierced the dome on the 9th April 1942 while 300 people were attending mass. The bomb did not explode and none of the people inside were harmed. This is a truly beautiful church with a rich history and definitely worth seeing while in Malta!

Summer is with us and a day trip to Comino is a must. Explore this beautiful island’s natural beauty and swim in the crystal clear waters of the blue lagoon.

[wpvideo 59cCR3Z2]

<strong> Comino and the Blue Lagoon</strong>
The tiny Island of Comino is situated right in the middle of the channel that separates mainland Malta from the island of Gozo. It is the smallest inhabited island of the Maltese Archipelago and the most pristine one, attracting all those who love swimming, snorkelling, diving, and other water sports. Between Comino and its adjacent island Cominotto lies the so-called Blue Lagoon.
This scenic bay with its crystal clear blue sea provides one of the most spectacular sights of the Maltese islands. Comino has an area of 1.5km2 and there are only about eight residents living on the Island. Traffic is non-existent and noise is the exception rather than the rule. The island does however boast a modern hotel, which caters for those who want to escape from it all.
<strong>History of Comino</strong>
There is a small church on Comino that is dedicated to the Return of Our Lady from Egypt. This was first built in 1618 but has been restored many times since then. A 12th century navigational map at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich shows a church where the present one stands. Comino is known to have been inhabited by farmers during Roman times; however for long periods in its history it has been sparsely populated, or abandoned entirely. In the middle ages, Comino was popular with pirates and marauders attracted by its rugged coastline delineated by sheer limestone cliffs and dotted with deep caves. Comino's caves and coves also frequently served as trading posts for raids on boats crossing between Malta and Gozo.
<strong>Knights of Malta in Comino</strong>
The Knights of Malta used Comino for hunting and as recreational grounds. The Knights were fiercely protective of the local game, which consisted of wild boar and hare. Upon conviction, poachers were liable to a penalty of three years as a galley slave. In 1416 the Maltese people petitioned their king, Alphonse V of Aragon, to build a tower on Comino Island to serve as an early warning system in case of invasion and to deter marauding Turks, pirates, smugglers and corsairs from using Comino as a hiding place and staging ground for devastating sorties onto the sister islands of Malta and Gozo. Two years later a special tax was levied on imported wine to raise funds for this project. However, the monies were diverted to the King's coffers, and the Island remained undefended for another two hundred years.
<strong>St. Mary's tower in Comino</strong>
In 1618, The Knights of Malta erected St. Mary's Tower (It-Torri ta' Santa Marija) on the orders of Grandmaster Wignacourt, designed by Maltese architect Vittorio Cassar. Funds for its construction were raised primarily by means of the sale of Comino brushwood. Located roughly in the centre of the southern coast of the Island, it formed part of a chain of defensive towers built by Wignacourt, Lascaris, and De Redin installed at vantage points along the coastline of the Maltese Islands, and greatly improved communications between the Islands of Malta and Gozo. The Tower is a large, square building with four corner turrets, located about 80 metres above sea level. The Tower itself is about 12 metres tall, with walls that are approximately 6 metres thick, and is raised on a platform and plinth that are approximately 8 metres high.
<strong>The history of Comino’s tower</strong>
Comino served as a place of imprisonment or exile in the 16th and 17th centuries for errant knights. Knights who were convicted of minor crimes were occasionally sentenced to the lonely and dangerous task of manning St. Mary's Tower. During times of crisis its garrison numbered up to 60 soldiers.By 1791 its armament included two 12-pound iron cannons, a 10-pound bronze cannon, a 4-pound bronze cannon, and two 3-pound bronze cannons. During the French Blockade (1798-1800), St. Mary's Tower served as a concentration camp for suspected spies.
In 1829 the British Military abandoned the tower and for several decades it was deemed to be property of the local civil authorities, and may have been used as an isolation hospital, or even as a wintering pen for farm animals. The Tower saw active service once again during both World Wars. In 1982 the Tower became the property of the Armed Forces of Malta and now serves as a lookout and staging post to guard against contraband and the illegal hunting of migratory birds at sea. St. Mary's Tower underwent extensive restoration between 2002 and 2004. Today, it remains the most notable structure on Comino, and provides a destination for tourists taking walks around the Island.

[wpvideo XxRIUU81]
<span lang="en-US">It’s no secret – summer in the Mediterranean is pretty amazing. What’s not to love? The long, sun-drenched days melt away into fiery sunsets and cool yet lively nights, and time spent relaxing isn’t just accepted, but actively encouraged by the locals. So what’s the best way to cool down when you’re visiting our gem of an island this summer?

<span lang="en-US">When you’re surrounded by gentle blue waves as far as the eye can see, it’s basically </span><span lang="en-US"><i>impossible </i></span><span lang="en-US"> to resist going for a dip. Snorkeling or scuba diving are two great ways to keep cool while you get up close and personal with the real ‘locals’ underwater. Grab your goggles and a set of flippers and get ready to be immersed in a cyan-coloured world so magical, you’l forget you live on land.</span>

<span lang="en-US">Revitalise your mind and body with a spot of yoga - but wit ha twist! SUP Yoga is ‘stand up paddle’ yoga, done on a surf board in calm waters. Even if your balance is on point, you might still find yourself ‘falling’ into that tempting blue sea to cool down after all that hard work.</span>

            [blog_content] => Planning your visit to the island of Gozo? Thinking what are the best beaches for a cool summer dip in the Mediterranean waters? You have probably heard of the famous Ramla Bay that is known for its redish-orange sand and is a visitors’ must during your stay in Gozo. Surrounded by cliffs on both sides, boasting clear waters and spacious accommodations, Ramla seems like the obvious choice. Moreover, it is easily accessible by car or public transport.
Yet in case you are feeling a bit more adventurous and would like to explore paths less travelled leading to more secluded, absolutely stunning beaches of Gozo, here is our guide to top five.
<b>Hondoq Ir Rummien</b>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4694" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/i1.jpg" alt="i1" width="1024" height="768" />Hondoq Bay is a small sandy beach that is easily reachable by car from Mgarr ferry station through the village of il-Qala. Nature lovers and avid hikers, not discouraged by heights, have the opportunity to take a charming coastal walk to Hondoq. Leave the Ferry Station torwards the Mgarr Marina. Walk past the Marina towards Zewwieqa Bay, which is a perfect spot for a quick cool-off swim before embarking on a ragged coastal path, which you will find at the end of the Zewwieqa Bay. The path is relatively safe although precautions should be taken and appropriate footwear is a must. Also drinking plenty of water is recommended to prevent sudden dehydration. The views including a distant glimpse of the famous Blue Lagoon of the Island of Comino, will be worth every drop of sweat you will expend on this walk.
Right before Hondoq Bay, you might be pleasantly surprised to discover a small inlet called Bemberejn. Surrounded by rock formation and sheltering turquoise waters it will be beckoning you to refresh yourself after a strenuous hike.


[gallery ids="4698,4697" type="rectangular"]
You will already be able to spot Hondq Bay from Bemberejn.
Hondoq Bay itself is a cozy, low-key hangout mostly for locals. You can rent a sunbed/umbrella combo and enjoy a variety of cold refreshments and delicious snacks from the Lunch Box stand just up the road. Another option is the little restaurant shack right across from the beach. You are welcome to taste their catch of the day, (also available in a fish amp; chips combo is you feel like indulging yourself) and enjoy a cold local beer variety called Cisk or another drink of your choice.
<b>Dahlet Qorrot</b>


[gallery ids="4703,4702" type="rectangular"]
Dahlet Qorrot is an old fishing bay. Its main attractions are multi-colored doors of charming boat houses build inside of the limestone formations surrounding the beach and of course, its iridescent, crystal clear waters to swim in. Moreover, with its abundant and colorful sea-life, the area of Dahlet Qorrot has become a beloved spot for diving and snorkeling.
The beach can be accessed by car from the Mgarr ferry station via the village of in-Nadur. Access by pubic transport is a bit tricky unless you are not afraid of a bit of a walk. If you choose to walk, however, you will be rewarded with beautiful sights of local farmland, lush green nature and gorgeous sea views.
If traveling by bus, take the number 303 either from Mgarr or Rabat Victoria (the central bus station of Gozo’s capital) and get off at the station Qorrot. Then follow the signs that will lead you out to a wide road gradually going downhill. Keep on walking down till you see the beach in the distance. When in doubt, however, ask the locals who are usually very kind and helpful towards lost tourists.
Dahlet Qurrot is a beloved hangout for locals and families as it is quite far away from the usual tourist destinations. In the summer months a small food truck with exceptionally kind and attentive staff will offer you a variety of hot and cold snacks as well as refreshing beverages and ice cream. Dahlet Qorrot is well worth visiting not only to enjoy a nice cool dip but also to get a feel for the local lifestyle of Gozitans.
<b>San Blas</b>


[gallery ids="4706,4701" type="rectangular"]
Located on the coastal side of the village in-Nadur, San Blas Bay is a tiny rustic beach with redish-orange sand, the same shade as Ramla Bay. Although the beach is quite secluded, it can be accessed by car via narrow road from in-Nadur. There are signs throughout the village to help you navigate. Be advised, however, that the last, rather steep portion of the road leading directly to the beach, is closed to traffic. Since the hike down (and up!) the steep road is not for the faint-hearted, the beach is relatively peaceful. On weekends, though there might be quite a few locals hanging out, parking their boats and coming to swim and relax on the beach. San Blas can also be accessed by bus 303 from the Mgarr ferry station or the main bus terminal in Rabat (Victoria). The bust stop to exit is Weraq (NOT Blas), which brings you directly to the top of the steep road offering breath-taking views of the bay.
The beach itself is low key with a cozy restaurant in a shaded area overlooking the bay. Take a seat at one of the wooden tables, and enjoy the beautiful sights while sipping wine and/or choosing between a variety of snacks and an abundance of seafood including fresh local fish.
<b>Mgarr ix-Xini </b>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4693" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/i11.jpg" alt="i11" width="1024" height="744" />
Mgarr ix-Xini is a narrow, secluded inlet close to the Gozitan villages of Ghajnsielem, Xewkija and Sannat. Ix-Xini can be accessed by car or on foot though I must warn you, it is not the easiest of walks: When leaving Mgarr ferry station, follow the south-eastern coastline passing Fort Chambray on your right, leading to a small local beach called Xatt Lahmar and several diving stations. Keep on the path around the coastline until you see the ix-Xini tower. Looking down from the cliffs, the astounding view of crystal blue waters will take your breath away. Aside from offering a purely aesthetic experience, ix-Xini is also a perfect spot for light swimming and relaxing on a sun bed. Those who would like more action, however, are welcome to try out diving and snorkeling. Although the beach waters are quite shallow and thus perfect for families with smaller children, a gradual slope will lead you into deeper seas. The rocks (some even have steps) on each side of the inlet provide a perfect platform for cliff jumping and diving into the crystal clear waters. Several caves in the cliff faces have become beloved exploration spots for divers and adventurers.
The back of the beach hosts a lovely restaurant with a natural tree cover for shade. The restaurant is famous for its amazing local fish dishes, selection of wines and local and foreign beers.
For history buffs, ix- Xini holds stories recounting events that took place during the Turkish invasion of the islands. You can still see steps that were used by the Turks to take the Gozitan captives to their ships. It is also noteworthy to mention that Mgarr ix-Xini was the location where the movie “By The Sea” was shot starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
<b>Ix- Xatt l-Ahmar</b>


[gallery ids="4704,4705" type="rectangular"]
Despite its very close location to the Mgarr ferry station, Xatt l-Ahmar is one of the quietest beaches in Gozo, located in the Gozitan village of Ghajnsielem. You can walk to the beach from Mgarr ferry station via Ghajnsielem following the road downward from Fort Chambray. On hot summer days though, trekking down the long windy road might be cumbersome, so a car would be a more convenient option.
The beach itself is an ideal location for divers particularly due to its main attraction: the shipwreck “Xlendi” which can be found at the depths of this location. For those who just want to relax and swim, the rocky surface with saltpans offers many nooks and crannies for cozily setting up your umbrellas, chairs and towels. This location does not have a restaurant or a food kiosk so taking your own drinks and food provision is a must. The gorgeous surroundings including the far off view of the Fort Chambray, makes this less known gem of a beach an ideal spot for romantic picnics or cozy family time.

            [blog_content] => Aside from its natural “wonders” Malta is well-known for its hospitality and a myriad of culinary delights ranging from traditional Maltese dishes (a blend of Sicilian, Arabic, English, French and Spanish cuisine) countless home-made Italian pasta varieties, an abundance of fresh and delicious seafood choices to endless fresh salad concoctions that will satisfy the most finicky of salad snobs. Also, let us not forget the generous assortment of sweets and pastry variations including mouth-watering Maltese bakes, French and Sicilian delicacies, and an array of raw, gluten-free, sugar-free and dairy-free desserts for the health conscious and/or those following specific diets.
When on holiday, it can be tricky to find a balance between wanting to spurge by trying everything under the sun and choosing between more wholesome options.
To make your journey through the endless maze of restaurants and cafe choices easier and more enjoyable, we have put together a guide of Malta’s cafes and restaurants that have been hits with locals, international foodies and the most demanding of gastronomes.
<strong>U Bistrot or as they call it themselves “Naturally Delicious Grub”</strong>
[gallery ids="4756,4755,4753" type="rectangular"]

​

Situated on the beautiful Balluta Bay, U Bistrot is one of the top tourist choices at any given time of the day as the restaurant is open from 10:00 am till 11:00 pm. In fact, if you happen to read their reviews, many deem the restaurant to be one of the best places to eat in Malta. Looking for a hearty morning grub? Their breakfast menu is rather impressive including a wide range of omelets, eggs benedict, English breakfast, an array of yummy pancake deals and Belgian waffles with maple, chocolate or caramel sauce. Freshly squeezed orange juice, healthy green or red juices, as well as flavorsome smoothies (no sugar added), are options if you want to up on your vitamin intake at breakfast. It’s important to mention that U Bistrot’s kitchen is vegetarian-friendly and also offer vegan and gluten-free options.

Crisp and delicious salad variations with a Mediterranean twist: such as cashew chicken, salmon ricotta, avocado walnut, warm root vegetables and mozzarella etc., served with a delicious home-made dressing and a mix of fresh local vegetables, are the top choices of fitness lovers and clean diet supporters.

Not into salads? Other scrumptious lunch options include elaborate homemade pasta dishes, risotto and gnocchi (gluten-free options included at a slight surcharge) or a variety of meat or veggie burgers, also available on gluten-free bread.

Still hungry? Check out their selection of mouth-watering desserts with (many customers will attest) possibly the best chocolate fondant on the whole island. Crème Brulee, vanilla mousse, a seasonal Pavlova with local strawberries and cream as well as multiple daily and weekly sweet treat additions are your other decadent options.

After a day of soaking up the Mediterranean sun, U Bistrot with its beautiful evening view overlooking Balluta Bay offering refreshing breeze is your perfect spot for a bountiful dinner. Catch of the day fried, grilled or baked with a side of fresh salad, grilled vegetables and/or potato varieties is one to definitely try if you fancy fish. Feeling like splurging a bit? Try the U Bistrot signature dish: sautéed king prawns with a side of crispy salad and toasted Maltese bread arguably one of the tastiest and healthiest wheat bread in Europe.

Not hungry but just wanna chill with a glass of wine or a cocktail? U Bistrot has a wide selection of high quality local and foreign wines as well as their trademark cocktails.
In case you have allergies, particular nutritional needs or other questions, the friendly and attentive U Bistrot staff will make sure you’ll have had a wonderful experience upon leaving the restaurant.
<strong>Mint: Café Sliema Malta</strong>
[gallery ids="4759,4758,4760" type="rectangular"]

ntrigued by the name? We suggest you definitely check out this charming New Zealand-style café situated right across from Font Ghadir Beach in Sliema. Owing to its exotic array of snacks, one-of-a-kind salad inventions and an abundance of home-made sweet treats, drinks, smoothies, and health juices Mint is beloved by foodies, fitness freaks, families and general by passers.

Open from 8 am to 4 pm only, the cafe is a popular place for breakfast and/or lunch. It is totally worth waking up early to watch the sunrise over the Ghadir Beach, take a dip in its golden waters and then head over to Mint for a chilled breakfast. Our personal recommendation is their sugar-, gluten- and dairy-free avocado cheesecake (freshly made in the morning) with a latte or a strong Americano. Not a fan of sugar-free, gluten-free and dairy-free treats? Not to worry! There are plenty of other yummy breakfast options available: freshly baked croissants, flapjacks, egg and bacon sandwiches and many more.

Trying to start your morning right? Enjoy one of their colorful seasonal juice/smoothie combos. Chilled watermelon juice is a definite hit during the summer months. Wanna spice things up? Add fresh ginger to your juices and smoothies.

Lunch is another culinary celebration at Mint. Elaborate salad combos consisting of a variety of fresh and grilled vegetables, grains, legumes and other additions (cheese, fish, grilled chicken or gourmet cold cuts) are designed to appease vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. Looking for something heartier? Exotic and scrumptious snacks changing weekly and daily such as Thai fishcakes, Aubergine melt, baked sweet potato, classic French Croque Monsieur just to name a few await to surprise and entice you. Usually quite a few vegetarian and vegan options are available daily as well. In case of food allergies it is advisable to consult the staff regarding your options.

Wait, wait, wait! We have not covered the desserts yet! All utterly delicious and making it impossible to choose! All made from scratch and with the best, wholesome ingredients in Mint’s kitchen. Gotta try the Mint’s signature New Zealand carrot cake or maybe their Lemon Meringue Pie? How about their Malibu Cream Cake? Maybe Strawberry amp;White Chocolate Cheesecake? The choices are endless and delectably tantalizing. Wondering if they have something less decadent? Try their Banana amp; Walnut loaf or their dairy-free Apple amp; Raspberry Loaf. Looking for gluten-free treats? Take advantage of Mint’s elaborate selection: Pavlova (seasonal), chocolate orange cake, chocolate hazelnut cake or lemon drizzle.

Kick back and relax with fresh, aromatic cup of coffee and a delicious slice, enjoy some awesome tunes and connect to interesting peeps from all over the globe. That’s Mint for you!
<strong>Pure Living, Sliema </strong>
[gallery ids="4751,4752,4761" type="rectangular"]

Pure Living was created by two passionate healthy food advocates Trevor Diacono and Debbie Kooy. Both enthusiasts have embraced the challenge to continuously create healthy, delicious and affordable meals and snacks by using naturally grown local produce (free of chemicals, pesticides and preservatives and refined sugar.), hence PURE products. The concept extends further than just healthy food as Pure Living is a comfy, cozy lounge restaurant in the heart of Sliema where you can sit on bean bags, sample organic products, enjoy ginger shots on the house and chat with Trevor (the owner) about exotic recipes and what healthy living entails. At the back of the restaurant, there is a small studio for yoga, meditation and Pilates classes (if interested in taking part, check out their class schedule online under Pure Classes www.pure.com.mt).

The breakfast and lunch choices for vegans, vegetarians, clean eaters, fitness enthusiasts and others who enjoy eating healthy, are endless. Let’s start with the salad bar where you pick your own ingredients: any type of vegetable imaginable under the sun and then add- ons such as chicken, salmon, eggs, feta, goat cheese or multiple vegetarian and vegan options such as falafels, beetroot or nut cakes and others.

Other absolute hits include Salmon Poached Egg amp; Guacamole, Poached Egg Avocado amp; Hollandaise, Oh My Goat Tartine, Fig, Avo amp; Feta and their to die for Acai bowls (see the pics!). BTW, vegan customers rave about their vegan hot dogs and vegan burgers.

Needing fuel after a vigorous morning workout? Try Pure Living Paleo Protein Pancakes (with or without the chocolate sauce) or their free-range scrambled eggs with fresh herbs.

Your other delicious options include the outside-the-box sandwich and wrap combos, Vietnamese Tofu noodles, Chili Con Carne, Vegan Chili Sin Carne, Fresh Grouper Fish Cakes and many more. And we absolutely HAVE to mention the Ultimate Vegan Lisa which is a gluten-free buckwheat pancake filled with falafels, guacamole, fresh greens and their signature chimichurri sauce.

There’s even a high-end dosage zero (no-sugar) Prosecco somewhere on the back of the shelves if you feel like celebrating.

How about stepping out of your comfort zone and trying a Tigernut Milk Latte or a Golden Latte, which is one of the most effective flue fighters out there.

Not a fan of healthy food? Come to Pure Living and you will be converted.


<strong>Il Kantra Lido, Gozo</strong>
[gallery ids="4762,4763,4746" type="rectangular"]
Picture yourself dining perched on a cliff by the water’s edge with a breath-taking view over the Mediterranean sea? Being part of the legendary Ta’ Cenc Hotel, Il-Kantra Lido/Beach Club is a “must” when visiting Gozo. Built on low-laying cliffs between two beautiful inlets Mgarr Xini and Kantra, the restaurant faces the sea offering a view of the Fessej Rock and a distant glimpse of Comino and northern Malta.
Open throughout the summer season (commencing at Easter and ending in late October), il Kantra Lido is a Mediterranean style bar and grill restaurant with an array of sea food, excellent fresh local fish, grilled meat dishes, delicious pasta variations prepared by chefs from Sicily, and a multitude of crisp, fresh salads with a generous base of local vegetables, all of which can be enjoyed with excellent wine in a fabulous setting. The restaurant is vegetarian friendly and offers gluten-free options as well. Upon arriving, you will be met by attentive and jovial staff members or even cordially greeted by the owner himself.
Il Kantra is an excellent choice on sweltering summer days as the top of the cliff offers a lovely breeze. You can sit comfortably in the shade sampling local wine or rent a sunbed near the cliff’s edge and soak up the sun while enjoying the view and feeling on the top of the world. At any given moment, you can take the steps down to the inlet where you will find crystal clear waters beckoning you to jump in and refresh. It must be noted though that this swimming area is for experienced swimmers and is not recommended for young children and the elderly.
Due to its strikingly beautiful albeit remote location, the Lido/Beach club is a generally peaceful area even during the high season for those seeking a secluded place to eat, enjoy wine and relax. The only time Il Kantra experienced a wake of bustling energy was during the filming of By The Sea when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were spotted in villages of Sannat and the neighboring Mgarr Xini.
Feeling adventurous? Take the dirt road from the Ta’ Cenc Hotel down to the inlets, and we promise this exotic al fresco dining experience will become one of the highlights of your trip.
<strong>Caffe Berry</strong>
[gallery ids="4748,4749,4747" type="rectangular"]
Caffe Berry is not just about getting your morning coffee fix, it is an experience! The quaint little cafe was rated 5 of 5 on Trip Advisor and is deemed by locals and visitors alike the “best little coffee shop in the world”, “the best Italian espresso on the island” “stellar products and service”, “the most delicious nutty coffees”. Skeptical? Save your opinion till you have tried their Berrychino Pistachio Latte, their Berrychino Hazelnut Latte or their summer hits: Iced Hazelnut or Pistachio Mocha.
Not a fan of Arabica? Looking for “healthier” options? Kick-start your morning with their Power Lattes: beetroot, turmeric, ginger or spirulina.
Your other choices are tea, fresh fruit smoothies, green juices, the best freshly squeezed orange juice in Sliema (we can personally attest to that) and of course, numerous dreamy pastry varieties: all homemade with spelt flour, non-refined sugars and fresh local organic ingredients. Gluten-free and vegan options are always available. Their most beloved treats appear to be the Bronte pistachio vegan tart, dark chocolate brownie with fresh peaches and organic almonds and their one of a kind tiramisu: alcohol- and refined sugar- free, made with organic rice and spelt flour, free range eggs and blue Arabica coffee.
All coffee lovers, foodies, health nuts and mindful living practitioners, welcome to the Caffee Berry experience! Stop by, sample the exotic blends, chat with the lovely owner herself, find out about her coffee philosophy, meet fascinating characters from all walks of live, enjoy!

            [blog_content] => During the summer months, fruit and vegetable stalls are coloured by the vibrant fruit of the prickly pear (<em>bajtar tax-xewk</em> in Maltese) cactus plant. Malta’s hot climate makes it an ideal place for these to grow. Why not have a taste while you're here?
First used by the Knights of St John for its moisturising properties, and later by farmers as a boundary to deter intruders from entering, the prickly pear fruit has more to offer than meets the eye. The prickly pear is also believed to have several medicinal properties and is sometimes used to help cure stomach aches, inflammations and insect bites.

Read on! </span>
<span style="font-size:large;"><b>Celebrate Independence Day </b></span>

https://www.instagram.com/p/BeJF71oDnB1/?utm_source=ig_share_sheetamp;igshid=rody3r4qyded
<span style="font-size:large;">The Independence monument commemorating this historic day can be found in Floriana, in front of the public garden area known as </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>The Mall</i></span><span style="font-size:large;"> and facing the entrance into Valletta. On Independence Day, several activities and events are held in and around Valletta to celebrate. </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>Festivals Malta</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">, a branch of the Maltese Arts Council, will be organising public arts events and visitors can </span><span style="font-size:large;">expect impromptu celebrations to pop up across the island. We suggest heading up to the Floriana/Valletta area early throughout the early morning to make the most of the celebratory atmosphere before moving on to the next stop on our itinerary. </span>
<span style="font-size:large;"><b>Get informed about Malta’s rich history</b></span>

<span style="font-size:large;">After a morning well-spent partaking in the outdoor events, we recommend paying a visit to </span><span style="font-size:large;"><i>The Malta Experience </i></span><span style="font-size:large;">located in the St. Elmo’s Bastions for an interactive and informative journey through the Maltese Islands’ past.

Tickets also include a guided tour through the</span><span style="font-size:large;"><i> La Sacra Infermeria</i></span><span style="font-size:large;">.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4788" src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/iv1.jpg" alt="IV1" width="718" height="474" />
<span style="font-size:large;">For an even more in-depth journey into the Maltese Islands’ intricate past, visitors might want to pay a visit to Fort St. Elmo. Renowned for protecting Malta throughout the Great Siege of 1565, Fort St. Elmo was strategically built to oversee and protect the Marsamxett Harbour, as well as the Grand Harbour. Today, the Fort is known as a historic building that houses Malta’s National War Museum and is famous for being a site used for national events. It has even been used in production filming! Additionally, visitors can request to visit the ramparts – a rewarding trip that features a splendid view of the Valletta waterfront. </span>

            [blog_content] => With epic beach club parties signaling the end of summer season in Malta, you may be feeling that all the fun is over now. Yet do not despair, we have plenty of excitement in store for you this coming fall season. All you have to do is take the ferry over to the island of Gozo. Whether you are a nature lover, a history buff, looking for art scene, culture or good time on a sail boat, Gozo has a bit of everything for everyone.
Let us give you the rundown of fall 2018 highlights on the Island of Gozo.
<b>Gozo Walks with Ivy</b>
Fall is the perfect time for exploring the islands outdoors. The weather is mostly sunny with clear skies and mild temps making it perfect for hiking, picnics, magnificent sunsets and lounging on the beach while soaking up the last of the gentle rays. The island of Gozo is full of hidden gems awaiting to be discovered by you: quaint towns with restaurants and bakeries off the beaten tourist path, pretty rock-enclosed beaches, spectacular nature trails with unique flora and fauna offering breath-taking views of the cliffs. None of the above are advertised online or in the mass tourism brochures. Feeling like an authentic Gozo adventure with cliff hikes, picnics, swims in exotic inlets, tastings of local produce and wine? Contact Ivy for a private tour: ivyevison@yahoo.com
<b>Historical Treasures of Gozo. </b>

If cliffs and beaches are not your cup of tea, the island of Gozo also offers a wealth of history and tradition. The warm, beautiful October days are ideal for visiting the island’s historical treasures. Once in Gozo, the first thing you will probably notice is the unique and distinguished shape of the Citadel (Cittadella), the highest structure on the island. The Citadel is an ancient fortress containing a whole city within its walls. It is believed to have been inhabited since the Bronze Age and has been listed as a non-active fortress for only about the last 150 years. Only a few families reside within the walls of the ancient fortress city today. Upon entering the Cittadella, you will have the opportunity to visit fascinating historical and architectural monuments such as the Old Prison, the Grain Silos, the Old Gunpowder Magazine, even a World War II shelter and a number of small museums: the Gozo Nature Museum, the Museum of Archeology, the Folklore Museum and others. Apart from its rich history, the Cittadella offers breath-taking views of the island’s landscape, encounters of rare flora and fauna species typical to the region and an assortment of cafes, restaurants and gift shops.
<img src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ggantija_temples_2.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-4808 size-full" height="2698" alt="Ggantija_Temples_2" width="4872">
© viewingmalta.com
Ggantija Temples is another experience you don’t want to miss when visiting Gozo. These megalithic temples from the New Stone Age are older than the pyramids of Egypt and Stonehenge. The findings suggest that the temples were used for religious rituals and ceremonies such as fertility rites as one can find fire hearths, holes in the floor most likely meant for liquid offerings and the evidence of animal bones implying animal sacrifices were performed. Right next to the Ggantija Temples you will find the Ta’ Kola Windmill which you can visit with the same ticket. The windmill was originally build during the Knights’ Period but had to be reconstructed later. Ta’ Kola Windmill is also one of few windmills that have survived. It is named after its last miller Zeppu ta’ Kola who took over the reparation of various destroyed and neglected windmills after the World War II. The Ta’ Kola Windmill offers an interesting historical account of the island’s bread, olive and wine culture and the typical lifestyle of the Gozitans.

Another immensely popular sacred religious site is Gozo is the Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary or Our Lady of Ta’ Pinu, which has been a beloved site for pilgrims and believers in miracles for centuries. In the year 1883 a woman from a near-by village heard the voice of the Blessed Virgin Mary beckoning her to visit the tiny chapel. Over the years multiple miracles were recounted in connection with the chapel such as recoveries from illnesses, the gift of fertility being restored and protection of soldiers in times of war.
Eventually the original chapel was replaced by an impressive Roman Catholic Basilica built between the years 1920-1931, yet the original foundation of the chapel was preserved, parts of which can still be seen today behind the altar. Once you enter the basilica you will be astounded by its opulent architecture, the grand sculptures, the six mosaics and painted windows. Yet the most intriguing aspect of the church are the two prayer rooms on either side of the altar. The walls of these two rooms are covered with recent and past stories, photos and other objects of evidence of miracles and answered prayers, such a regaining ability to walk, full accident recoveries, business and personal success stories and a multitude of blessings of every kind. The interior of the basilica is also being referred to as an “Oasis of Peace” offering a place for quiet reflection and meditation away from every day noises, chaos and troubles.
<b>Art and Culture Evens in Gozo Fall 2018</b>
<img src="https://shortletsmalta.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fm.jpg" class="wp-image-4810 aligncenter size-full" height="244" alt="fm.jpg" width="365">

Watch as the Ghar Ilma hill covered in lanterns, lights up in hundred little flames casting a truly magical glow over the uniquely beautiful landscape of the island. After the lighting ceremony, you are welcome to visit the town of Santa Lucia to witness the children’s candle procession, sample local goodies and simply get to know the kind-spirited Gozitans.
<b>Lust for Life Day Charters Malta/Gozo</b>

            [blog_content] => Birgu, also known as ‘Città Vittoriosa’ is an old fortified city facing Valletta, and it’s the place where the Knights of St. John first settled. Not only is this small city bursting with history, architecture, and museums but it also has a beautiful marina with cafes and restaurants along the waterfront. Whether visiting during the day or in the evening, Birgu is definitely worth it.

<span lang="mt-MT">Birgufest is a celebration of culture, art, and most importantly of the beauty of the historic walled city of Vittoriosa, known to the locals as Birgu. Vittoriosa is one of Malta’s oldest cities, having been the seat of the Knights of Malta before the city of Valletta was built. Nowadays this miniscule city is as quaint as they get, its alleyways twisting this way and that, leading you to unexpected beautiful sights. During the annual Birgufest, this city is illuminated by hundreds of candles, which replace the usual streetlamps. This creates a wonderful, intimate atmosphere, heightened by the various art and music performances throughout the streets. Food stalls will also be available throughout the city, while entrances to museums and historical buildings will be discounted. </span>

<span lang="mt-MT">During the rule of Grand Master Perellos, it is said that cocoa beans, a luxury at the time, were stored in the town of Hamrun, in the area known as ‘Tas-Samra’. This connection birthed the Hamrun Chocolate Festival, a yearly event of delicious chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate! This year the festival will be celebrating its 10 year mark, making celebrations bigger and better. Expect marvellous creations done entirely out of chocolate, as well as traditional Maltese delicacies which will make any chocaholic drool!
